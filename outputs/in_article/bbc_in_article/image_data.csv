https://www.bbc.com,bbc_in_article,1,1,ZELENKSY/TELEGRAM Zelensky posted this photo of the scene where he says Russian artillery killed three aid workers,Three Red Cross staff killed in strike in eastern Ukraine,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4glgex9przo,"The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says three of its workers have been killed, and two others injured in a strike in eastern Ukraine. The ICRC did not identify who was behind the attack but called it ""unconscionable"" that ""shelling would hit an aid distribution site"". Earlier, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said those killed were Ukrainian and blamed Moscow for the shelling, calling it ""another Russian war crime"". The agency said its vehicles are clearly marked and operate regularly in the frontline region of Donetsk. ""I condemn attacks on Red Cross personnel in the strongest terms,"" said the agency's president Mirjana Spoljaric, adding that: ""Our hearts are broken today as we mourn the loss of our colleagues and care for the injured."" The ICRC said its team had been preparing to distribute wood and coal briquettes to homes in Viroliubivka village, north of Donetsk city, when it was hit. The distribution of the goods had not begun yet and no residents were affected by the explosion, the agency said. It did not confirm any details about the identities of those killed. Earlier, Ukrainian officials had reported shelling in Viroliubivka and said workers had been unloading supplies when the attack happened.  In a post on social media, Ukraine's leader blamed a Russian strike. Zelensky shared a photo of a white truck in flames branded with the Red Cross logo on its side. ""Today, the occupier attacked the vehicles of the International Committee of the Red Cross humanitarian mission,"" he said. The Ukrainian ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets also commented online, urging the Red Cross to publicly attribute the attack to Russia. ""The shelling is already known about, but the ICRC... remain silent!"" he wrote.  In its statement, the ICRC had reiterated that it is a ""neutral, impartial and independent organisation with an exclusively humanitarian mandate"".  It deplored the ""sharp rise"" in the killings of humanitarians around the world in the past two years. The United Nations has also made similar warnings. Its humanitarian mission to Ukraine earlier this year said 50 workers had killed or injured in Ukraine in 2023, including 11 killed in the line of duty, reported AFP news agency."

On a Sunday in the Broadmoor neighbourhood of New Orleans earlier this year, a church full of voices can be heard singing the hymn This Little Light of Mine. But letting it shine has now taken on a whole new meaning for residents in the city. In 2023, the brownstone Broadmoor Church's rooftop was kitted out with a raft of new solar panels, turning that sunlight into energy for local residents.  The church is one of 86 planned ""community lighthouses"", and part of a wider project to build the nation's largest network of solar and storage resilience hubs at places of worship and community centres. The project is spearheaded by Together Louisiana, a non-profit organisation supported by local and federal funding, to transform these centres into energy-resilient hubs. As Tropical Storm Francine, which made landfall as a category two hurricane, continues to inundate Louisiana, the need to adapt to such severe storms is growing. (Read more about how hurricanes are becoming more extreme with climate change.) New Orleans' community lighthouses are in their early days, with 10 currently operational in the city, and are now facing their first major test. As of the early hours of 12 September, the grid was out in five of them. Speaking to the BBC earlier in the 2024 hurricane season, the project's organisers explained their plans for a life-saving model to provide crucial power in the immediate aftermath of a storm. The community lighthouses function as solar-powered microgrids to provide power during grid failure and outages caused by extreme weather, such as hurricanes. The solar-power network also has back-up battery capacity, meaning the community can stay powered when conventional power sources are overcome by extreme winds and flooding. ""It takes just four of our batteries that store power from our solar panels to stay around 96% full and allow us to run for around a day when the grid goes down,"" the church's pastor and Broadmoor community lighthouse manager Gregory Manning says.  Manning's church is part of a hub which will eventually serve 200 people from the surrounding area. During extreme weather, their daily electricity needs can be met – everything from small essentials like mobile phone charging to life-saving services, such keeping medicine cool and providing protection from extreme heat. Louisiana locals say these community hubs can make a substantial difference during a hurricane. With an extremely active Atlantic hurricane season ramping up, it may not be long before the lighthouses are put to their first serious test. Between 1980 and 2023, there were on average of 8.5 billion-dollar extreme weather events across the US. During 2019-2023, that figure more than doubled to 20.4 events a year. Louisiana is in the top three states for the costliness of extreme weather and climate disasters since 1980 according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), behind Texas and Florida. However, Louisiana's smaller population and economy can make those costs especially hard to bear. Overall, extreme weather has cost Louisiana $290bn (£225bn) since 1980. With these hazards now arriving in quicker succession, there's less time for recovery, Rob Verchick, professor of law at Loyola University, tells the BBC. Mastering the microgrid Systems capable of operating independently from the main power grid, known as microgrids, are gaining attention as extreme weather events become more frequent. The US military, for instance, aims to improve the power resilience of its bases a part of the Department of Defence's policy. Microgrids currently provide less than 0.3% of the US's electricity but interest in them is growing for both environmental and practical reasons. The microgrid market is expected to grow significantly in the next years, particularly in Asia-Pacific and North America, with annual capacity installation and spending expected to climb fivefold between 2018 and 2027. More than one million people were left without power after 2021's Hurricane Ida. Across the Gulf Coast, the most common cause of death from Ida was excessive heat during extended power outages. ""Hurricane Ida was a pivotal moment for the city,"" Manning says. ""That taught us what we really needed to do, we realised that we have the power ourselves to get together a plan."" Founding member of Together Louisiana's community lighthouse project, Broderick Bagert says the neighbourhood felt ""powerless"" during Hurricane Ida. As he saw local government battle to try and provide the basics after the disaster, he and the team began to see how they could take matters into their own hands. ""Having been through this in Hurricanes Ida, Isaac, Katrina and Laura, we came to the conclusion that every neighbourhood needs one facility that has resilient power and can keep electricity when the grid goes down,"" says Bagert. When a hurricane causes grid failure, the Broadmoor Church solar panels and back-up batteries operate off-grid, providing up to 20kW of power – enough to charge phones and run large refrigerators and freezers that can store 10,000lbs (450kg) of food.  But it's not just about these physical hubs, Bagert adds, as it is creating a community who can identify vulnerable individuals – the elderly, those living alone, or those without transport – and ensure they can access the resources they need. The aim is for each hub to be able to contact everyone in the network within 24 hours in the event of an extreme weather emergency. ""This starts from grassroots to try to get a response that becomes systemic, one that checks in on people in their neighbourhoods – we're in the early stages of developing this across our state,"" says Bagert. Broadmoor Community Lighthouse was one of the first three to be completed in the planned lighthouse network. The Together Louisiana network includes civic centres and places of worship while also incorporating environmental and workers groups. The coalition says it is ""deliberate about crossing the lines of race, religion, neighbourhood, and political affiliation"" to help communities and build upon the places people already know and use frequently.  Almost one in four people live in poverty in New Orleans, which is twice the national average for America, making evacuation during extreme weather events untenable – many residents simply can't afford to. Manning says the lighthouses will be a ""lifeline"" for those ""we know can't get out"".  The financial toll of this extreme weather is heavy. Louisiana's largest power company estimated the damage repairs from hurricanes in 2020 and 2021 would cost more than $4bn (£3.1bn). Last October, the federal government approved a $259m (£200m) grant to Louisiana to implement the community lighthouse project. It is the largest investment in grid resilience in the state's history and part of President Biden's biggest ever investment in the US electric grid, committing $3.46bn (£2.7bn) for 58 clean energy projects across 44 states.  Each community lighthouse uses four Tesla batteries for power storage, an automatic load control panel – replacing an electricity control panel from the 1950s – and two monitoring systems. They can also store excess solar energy in back-up batteries, and their energy efficiency is expected to reduce the Broadmoor community's utility costs by around $170,000 (£130,000) over the batteries' lifetimes – as well as reducing carbon emissions for the facility. Fatalities from knock-on effects of hurricanes have made up almost as many deaths as the immediate dangers of storm surge and flooding in the past 10 years in the US. In some storms, indirect effects outweigh direct effects. During Hurricane Ida, there were four direct and 26 indirect deaths in Louisiana, 13 of which were attributed to heat exhaustion due to the lack of air conditioning as the heat index reached 33C (92F). To keep air conditioners on when the grid fails, conventional generators are often used. However, this can come with its own tragic consequences. Six indirect deaths during Hurricane Ida were due to carbon monoxide poisoning, which is a risk associated with generators. New Orleans resident Cynthia Coleman lost two family members to carbon monoxide poisoning during the storm. ""The entire state was in darkness and my 54-year-old godmother and her grandchildren purchased a generator because it was so hot and they were just trying to survive,"" she says. It was their first time using the device, and Coleman's godmother and her godmother's 17-year-old grandson ""went to sleep that night and didn't wake up"". They had died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the generator. Coleman says she believes the community lighthouses, with clean power, could have saved them. ""They didn't have what they needed to be comfortable – basic electricity,"" she says. ""I had to see coffins in the church."" She considers the lighthouses ""priceless"" in the face of extreme storms. ""It eliminates the thought that another family member can suffer loss for situations should have been better handled,"" Coleman says. ""I can't get them back but this encourages myself and my family that someone else will not have to experience what we did – it will help someone else."" When all 86 planned community lighthouse facilities are functioning, they will be stationed at no more than a 15-minute walking distance for the 380,000 residents of New Orleans. When Hurricane Francine arrived, the operational lighthouses were charged and holding up well, with batteries providing much-needed power. Asked about the state's future, Manning is cautious but hopeful.  ""I wouldn't say confident, but I feel good about the steps we're taking and that we're making progress,"" he says. ""More needs to be done and we need to move quickly – we have to catch up from the steps that we did not take over the past two years."" * This story was originally published on 7 August 2024, and updated with details on Hurricane Francine on 12 September 2024. -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Russia had begun ""counter-offensive actions, which is going in line with our Ukrainian plan"". Russia said its ""Units of the North"" forces had reclaimed the settlements over two days in the area around Snagost, on the western flank of the area occupied by Ukraine in its campaign launched on 6 August. The first indication of a counteroffensive had come from Chechen special forces commander, Maj Gen Apti Alaudinov, who said six Ukrainian brigades had suffered heavy casualties. A Ukrainian officer fighting in the Kursk region told the BBC that the Russian counteroffensive had begun some distance to the west of Sudzha. ""The fighting is very tough and the situation is not in our favour as of now,"" the officer said on condition of anonymity. Ukraine's offensive was launched with the apparent aim of distracting Russia from its push into eastern Ukraine. It now claims up to 1,300 sq km (500 sq miles)  of Russian territory. However, Russian forces continued to seize villages in eastern Ukraine and are closing in on the strategic town of Pokrovsk. Analysts from the US-based Institute for the Study of War said the size, scale and potential prospects of the Russian counterattacks were unclear and it was premature to draw any conclusions. One social media account linked to a Ukrainian brigade said Russian forces had unexpectedly launched their attack near Snagost and that the Ukrainians were fighting back. Russian military expert Anatoly Matviychuk told the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper that more than 100 sq km of territory had been recaptured and ""the enemy's reserves, reinforcements, and logistical supplies can no longer reach Kursk region"". Russia's military was caught by surprise by the scale and intensity of the Ukraine incursion into Kursk region early last month. Although Moscow was stunned by the ease with which Ukrainian forces seized towns and villages including Sudzha, President Vladimir Putin said almost a month afterwards that they had failed. Ukrainian forces had tried to make Russia nervous - ""to scurry, to send troops from one area to another and to stop our offensive in key areas, above all in Donbas"" - he said.  Not only had it not worked, Putin argued that Ukraine's offensive had merely helped Moscow's ""primary objective"", which he identified as capturing the Donbas - Ukraine's industrial regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Russian forces are now only a few kilometres outside Pokrovsk and its adjoining town Myrnohrad and fierce fighting is reported on the approaches to the Pokrovsk. An overpass between the two towns was destroyed overnight into Thursday and the Donetsk regional head said a water supply line to Pokrovsk had also been cut, although he said the town had access to several wells. Meanwhile, a Russian drone attack left 14 people wounded in the northern Ukrainian town of Konotop, a key hub used by Kyiv for preparing its Kursk campaign. Prosecutors in the Sumy border region posted photographs showing damaged apartment blocks in the town. Power supplies to Konotop were down because of the strike and officials said energy infrastructure had been significantly damaged."

https://www.bbc.com,bbc_in_article,4,1,"BBC Rachel Oviedo, 57, sits on her porch",Trump's message of American decline resonates with pivotal voters,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0nerwe8rro,"Kamala Harris may have rattled Donald Trump on the debate stage, but the former president’s promise to save a nation in decline resonates with undecided voters in this part of a key battleground state. It took Paul Simon four days to hitchhike from Saginaw, or so he sang in America, his iconic soundscape ballad of the 1960s with its lost souls on the highways of a country in flux. Back then, this city’s long, slow decline had already begun, as Michigan’s once mighty car factories pulled down the shutters, buffeted by the winds of foreign competition. Today, the angst and loneliness of Simon and Art Garfunkel’s song are magnified many times over. I found 57-year-old Rachel Oviedo sitting on her porch, staring out at abandoned furniture in the street and beyond, the shell of a plant that once made car parts for Chevrolets and Buicks, but finally closed its doors in 2014. “We sit here all day long,” she told me. “We see homeless people come in and out of there, they need to tear it down and make something out of it.” “A grocery store,” she suggested. “Because we ain’t got no grocery stores round here.” I first met her the day before Tuesday night’s debate in Philadelphia, when she told me she was still unsure of how she was going to vote. Donald Trump, she said, felt like a known quantity and like “a man of his word”, while Kamala Harris looked promising but still somewhat unknown. “I like her,” she said, “but we don’t know what she’s going to do.” Most US states lean either so strongly Democratic or so strongly Republican that the result is a foregone conclusion. And if Michigan is one of the few swing states, then Saginaw is one of the few places in it where the vote could genuinely go either way. When they come to cast their ballots, it will be undecided voters like Rachel, in places like this, who’ll quite literally have the future of America in their hands. Chuck Brenner, a retired Saginaw cop, is another one. The 49-year-old, who still works part time in probation and runs his own real estate company, says he’s seen up close the problems here. “Almost everybody’s dad worked in the car industry,” he told me. “Back then, everybody had money and jobs were readily available. You’ve seen the change, people are struggling because people are growing up poor and then drugs and all that.” Trump’s message of American decline resonates with Chuck. “Absolutely,” he told me. “Because you can see it.” But although he voted for Mr Trump in 2016, he went for Joe Biden in 2020. “There was a lot of drama with Trump,“ he added. “And the legal issues. I kind of got sick of that.” This time round, he’d only make up his mind, he insisted, once he’d watched the debate and heard what both candidates had to say. Saginaw, like the wider state of Michigan, was once solid Democrat country - its political inclinations revealed in the list of candidates it has backed down the decades: Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama and Joe Biden. That 2016 vote, when Saginaw went – like Mr Brenner – for Trump, marked a shift. You don’t have to spend long here to realise just how remarkable a shift that was. Jeremy Zehnder runs a truck-polishing company, doing the kind of work Democrats used to be able to depend on for support. Surrounded by the giant, gleaming trucks and trailers, the lifeblood of the American economy’s distribution networks, he tells me it’s not debate performances, but the cost of living that will determine how he votes. And a majority of voters tell pollsters they trust Trump more on the economy. “With the truckers, every one of those that we know of are leaning towards the right,” he told me. “What, every one?” I ask. “I don’t know of one that isn’t,” he replied. “I mean we do hundreds of trucks every year. And they all want to talk about it, everybody talks about it.” At a United Auto Workers Union event where members watched the debate, I met one of the union organisers, Joe Losier. The UAW has pledged its support to Kamala Harris and much of the crowd in the room whooped and clapped with every put-down she threw Trump’s way. But dig a bit deeper and the fault lines of America’s political upheaval can be found here, too. “My dad and all my uncles on both sides of my family, who are all UAW people, have become Republicans,” Mr Losier told me, unable to hide the incredulity in his own voice. “These are second generation immigrants who came over here, started working in the auto industry back in World War One and it blows my mind that a lot of my family are tradesmen who are supporting Donald Trump.” He’s even unsure which way his two adult sons are going to vote. Dinner times are “horrible”, he said. With workers fearing further shift cuts and job losses, the union finds itself increasingly out of step with its members. There’s deep support here for Donald Trump’s promise of tough tariffs on imports, and disagreement with Kamala Harris’s argument in the debate that the policy would simply drive up prices. After the debate, I called Chuck Brenner to see what he’d made of it. He had some good news for Democrats. “I do believe Kamala was the shining star,” he told me. “And the bottom line is she’s won my vote. I was impressed by what she had to say, her delivery.” “With Trump,” he went on, “it was kind of what I expected. There were no surprises there. It’s kind of like the same. The same.” Rachel Oviedo was still undecided, she told me, but now leaning more towards Trump. “I think he’ll do more for us up here,” she said. “You know, he did things he shouldn’t have done”, she added. “But you gotta forgive people.” And Jeremy Zehnder, the truck polisher, admitted to being slightly surprised by Harris’s performance. “She did much better than I thought she would,” he told me. “I think she won it.” But he’s sticking with Trump. It’s about policy, he said. Taxes, the border and the cost of living. On the streets of Saginaw, Kathleen Skelcy was knocking on doors, busy canvassing for Harris. She told me she finds it a struggle to see any rationale behind the political motivations of her opponents. “That’s what’s scary, trying to understand these people and their thinking,” she said. “I just think they’re not educated, or they fell asleep in school or something.” It’s easy to see this as patronising, another sign that some Democrats chalk Trump’s appeal as merely delusional. It's clear, however, that trust and understanding can be in short supply on both sides. As we’re talking, a Trump supporter, aggressive and threatening, emerges shouting from his home, following Kathleen up the street. “Harris is a clown,” he yells, adding a few profanities for good measure. And on the doorsteps, one Democratic supporter declines the offer of a Harris sign for their front yard, scared, they say, of inviting similar abuse. In a few weeks, Saginaw will go the polls. Before then, it’s almost certain that many more journalists will pass through this key bellwether district, all of them looking for America. It’s here alright, in all its striving and struggling, and in a story today being lived out in stark political division. A debate needs middle ground.  And there’s very little of that left.

Chuck Brenner, a retired Saginaw cop, is another one. The 49-year-old, who still works part time in probation and runs his own real estate company, says he’s seen up close the problems here. “Almost everybody’s dad worked in the car industry,” he told me. “Back then, everybody had money and jobs were readily available. You’ve seen the change, people are struggling because people are growing up poor and then drugs and all that.” Trump’s message of American decline resonates with Chuck. “Absolutely,” he told me. “Because you can see it.” But although he voted for Mr Trump in 2016, he went for Joe Biden in 2020. “There was a lot of drama with Trump,“ he added. “And the legal issues. I kind of got sick of that.” This time round, he’d only make up his mind, he insisted, once he’d watched the debate and heard what both candidates had to say. Saginaw, like the wider state of Michigan, was once solid Democrat country - its political inclinations revealed in the list of candidates it has backed down the decades: Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama and Joe Biden. That 2016 vote, when Saginaw went – like Mr Brenner – for Trump, marked a shift. You don’t have to spend long here to realise just how remarkable a shift that was. Jeremy Zehnder runs a truck-polishing company, doing the kind of work Democrats used to be able to depend on for support. Surrounded by the giant, gleaming trucks and trailers, the lifeblood of the American economy’s distribution networks, he tells me it’s not debate performances, but the cost of living that will determine how he votes. And a majority of voters tell pollsters they trust Trump more on the economy. “With the truckers, every one of those that we know of are leaning towards the right,” he told me. “What, every one?” I ask. “I don’t know of one that isn’t,” he replied. “I mean we do hundreds of trucks every year. And they all want to talk about it, everybody talks about it.” At a United Auto Workers Union event where members watched the debate, I met one of the union organisers, Joe Losier. The UAW has pledged its support to Kamala Harris and much of the crowd in the room whooped and clapped with every put-down she threw Trump’s way. But dig a bit deeper and the fault lines of America’s political upheaval can be found here, too. “My dad and all my uncles on both sides of my family, who are all UAW people, have become Republicans,” Mr Losier told me, unable to hide the incredulity in his own voice. “These are second generation immigrants who came over here, started working in the auto industry back in World War One and it blows my mind that a lot of my family are tradesmen who are supporting Donald Trump.” He’s even unsure which way his two adult sons are going to vote. Dinner times are “horrible”, he said. With workers fearing further shift cuts and job losses, the union finds itself increasingly out of step with its members. There’s deep support here for Donald Trump’s promise of tough tariffs on imports, and disagreement with Kamala Harris’s argument in the debate that the policy would simply drive up prices. After the debate, I called Chuck Brenner to see what he’d made of it. He had some good news for Democrats. “I do believe Kamala was the shining star,” he told me. “And the bottom line is she’s won my vote. I was impressed by what she had to say, her delivery.” “With Trump,” he went on, “it was kind of what I expected. There were no surprises there. It’s kind of like the same. The same.” Rachel Oviedo was still undecided, she told me, but now leaning more towards Trump. “I think he’ll do more for us up here,” she said. “You know, he did things he shouldn’t have done”, she added. “But you gotta forgive people.” And Jeremy Zehnder, the truck polisher, admitted to being slightly surprised by Harris’s performance. “She did much better than I thought she would,” he told me. “I think she won it.” But he’s sticking with Trump. It’s about policy, he said. Taxes, the border and the cost of living. On the streets of Saginaw, Kathleen Skelcy was knocking on doors, busy canvassing for Harris. She told me she finds it a struggle to see any rationale behind the political motivations of her opponents. “That’s what’s scary, trying to understand these people and their thinking,” she said. “I just think they’re not educated, or they fell asleep in school or something.” It’s easy to see this as patronising, another sign that some Democrats chalk Trump’s appeal as merely delusional. It's clear, however, that trust and understanding can be in short supply on both sides. As we’re talking, a Trump supporter, aggressive and threatening, emerges shouting from his home, following Kathleen up the street. “Harris is a clown,” he yells, adding a few profanities for good measure. And on the doorsteps, one Democratic supporter declines the offer of a Harris sign for their front yard, scared, they say, of inviting similar abuse. In a few weeks, Saginaw will go the polls. Before then, it’s almost certain that many more journalists will pass through this key bellwether district, all of them looking for America. It’s here alright, in all its striving and struggling, and in a story today being lived out in stark political division. A debate needs middle ground.  And there’s very little of that left.

https://www.bbc.com,bbc_in_article,5,1,"AFP An aerial shot shows Coldstream Guards standing to attention while wearing their distinctive red uniform and black bearskin caps, as a low sun casts long shadows on the tarmac outside Buckingham Palace during the State Funeral of Queen Elizabeth II on September 19, 2022 in London",Soaring cost of King’s Guards' real fur bearskin caps revealed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gly3l8y45o,"The bearskin caps worn by soldiers outside Buckingham Palace now cost more than £2,000 each, figures from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) show. The cost of the ceremonial caps, made from the fur of black bears, soared by 30% in a year, according to figures revealed in response to a Freedom of Information request from animal welfare campaigners. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) group are against using real fur in principle, but they say it is also now a financial as well as an ethical issue, with £1m spent on fur caps in recent years. The MoD said: “We are open to exploring faux fur alternatives if they pass the necessary requirements."" However, the ministry spokesman said a fake fur version would have to satisfy ""safety and durability considerations"" and that ""no alternative has met all those criteria to date"". The sharp increase in price is explained by the MoD as the result of a change in the ""contractual arrangements"" for the caps, which are all made from the fur of bears hunted in Canada. The cost of the caps worn by the King's Guard rose from £1,560 each in 2022 to £2,040 in 2023. Elisa Allen, of Peta, called on the MoD to ""stop wasting taxpayer pounds on caps made from slaughtered wildlife, and switch to faux fur today"". The distinctive tall caps are worn on ceremonial events such as Trooping the Colour, and the figures from the MoD show that 24 new caps were bought in 2023 and 13 in 2022. Over the past decade the amount spent on replacement caps has been more than £1m. Defenders of using real fur caps have argued that they are long-lasting and maintain their appearance for such showcase military occasions. Animal welfare campaigners have claimed it is cruel and unnecessary for the King's Guard to use real fur, saying it takes the fur of one bear to make each bearskin. The decision on the use of real fur is up to the MoD rather than the royals, but as the BBC previously revealed, Queen Camilla switched this year to only buying fake fur clothes, saying in a letter she would ""not procure any new fur garments"". There has been criticism from Peta of how black bears are caught and killed, with accusations that hunters can use crossbows, and the animals might suffer for a long time. However, the MoD says all of the fur it uses comes from legal and licensed hunts from the regulated Canadian market, and that bears are not ""hunted to order"" to make the caps. There are fake fur alternatives on offer to make the caps, including a fabric made from synthetic fibres - proposed by Peta. But the MoD is not yet convinced that fake fur meets the five tests it has set for a bearskin alternative, in terms of its comfort and keeping its shape in all types of weather. Those tests are ""water absorption, penetration, appearance, drying rate and compression"". In opposition, Labour's then-shadow defence minster Stephanie Peacock had called for ""an immediate review of the possible alternatives to bear fur, taking an in-depth look at contracts and costs"". She had told the House of Commons: ""It is incredibly important that traditions develop and adapt if they are to survive."" With Labour now in government, the MoD says it is open to considering fake fur alternatives and would welcome the submission of samples of materials for testing.

https://www.bbc.com,bbc_in_article,6,1,Getty Images Horse riders compete at the fifth World Nomad Games in Astana (Credit: Getty Images),World Nomad Games: The spectacular 'Olympics' of Central Asia,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240912-world-nomad-games-the-spectacular-olympics-of-central-asia,"The fifth World Nomad Games kicked off this week in Kazakhstan's capital of Astana. Dubbed the ""Great Gathering on the Steppe"", the Olympics of the nomadic world is a spectacular celebration of traditional sports, identity and culture from across inner Asia. Part Highland Games, part Mongolian Naadam festival, and featuring sports like horseback wrestling and Central Asian strongman competitions, the World Nomad Games give a flavour of what the Olympics might have looked like if Genghis Khan had been in charge. Indeed, many of the sports have their roots in the skills required to survive on the steppe and in the unrivalled equestrian abilities that fuelled a millennium-long wave of successive steppe empires, from the Huns to the Mongols. There are traditional events such as archery and long-distance horse races, but the Games also promote Kazakh food, traditional dress and even the art of epic storytelling. The goal is to preserve and protect nomadic and steppe culture, which is under increasing threat from globalisation, modernisation and even climate change. The World Nomad Games take place every two years and shifts locations as frequently as the nomads it celebrates. The next event in 2026 will likely head back to Kyrgyzstan, where the inaugural event began in 2014. This year's competition concludes on Friday 13 September. The opening ceremony on 8 September was a spectacular affair, with 3,000 athletes from 89 countries filing into the arena, as hundreds of musicians, dancers and singers performed in front of Central Asia's political elite. The show traced the history of the Kazakh steppe from ancient Scythian warriors and Silk Road merchants to the rise of the Golden Horde and the Kazakh khanate in the 15th Century. Performers depicted scenes of the steppe convening under the symbolic embroidered panels of a yurt (pictured above), a reference to the gatherings of nomadic confederations that occurred periodically to enthrone a new khagan (ruler). This Games favourite – known variously across the region as kokpar, kok buru, ulak tartysh and buzkashi – is best described in English as rugby on horseback with a dead goat as a ball. Two teams of seven horsemen compete to grab hold of the headless carcass (made of rubber for these games), hoist it under their leg, sprint for the opposition's line and then dump it in a ring of rope or a large plastic doughnut. Rough and tumble is putting it mildly; broken fingers and ripped ears are par for the course. ""The most important attribute for a kokpar player is to be strong, to be brave and to not be afraid,"" said the Kazakh team captain, Kermenbek Turganbek Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are the two great kokpar rivals and 20,000 people are expected to watch them in the final on 13 September.  Hunting with eagles is one of the more unusual of the 21 official sports featured in the Games. It takes many years for an experienced eagle hunter (known as a berkutchi) to tame and train a wild golden eagle (berkut), and the expense and time required makes it the most endangered of the Games' traditional sports. The event has three categories at the competition: hunting with eagles, hawks or falcons. All have their roots in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and western Mongolia, where the hunting of foxes, rabbits and wolves traditionally takes place in winter when the animals' fur is thickest. Wrestling on horseback (audaryspak) takes place in a 15m-diameter sandy arena and bouts are divided into six weight categories. The aim is to pull one's opponent onto the ground, but wrestlers can also get points for lifting their opponent from the saddle or pushing them out of the circle. Horses get penalised for biting. Other forms of non-horseback wrestling (known as kureshi, kurash or koresh in Turkic languages) include specific Kazakh, Turkish, Tatar and Kyrgyz styles, most of which also include female competitions, unlike many of the Games' sports. Archery (both ground and on horseback) is the sport that is perhaps most evocative of inner Asia's warrior past. For centuries waves of mounted archers overwhelmed cities across the Middle East and Eastern Europe, who were left helpless by the steppe people's unrivalled mastery of iron stirrups and composite bows. ""Chinggis [Genghis] Khan's blood is in my blood,"" said Mongolian archer Tsetsegsuren Dorjsuren. ""I feel my ancestors when I pick up my bow."" Mas-wrestling, sometimes known as stick tug of war, has its roots in Yakutiya (today's Sakha Republic, one of several Turkic republics in the Russian Federation, who attended the 2024 Games. Athletes sit facing each other with their feet on a board, both holding a wooden stick, or mas. The aim is to grab the stick from your opponent or pull your opponent over to your side (think: over-sized toddlers fighting over a toy). There are separate men's and women's competitions. The World Nomad Games is about much more than simply sport. At the heart of the half-dozen sporting venues is the Ethno-aul (aul means village in Kazakh), a collection of yurts, craft shops and local restaurants where reenactors dress as medieval warriors and musicians and perform ancient folk songs. Picture above, these women in traditional Kazakh dress stand in front of an apple tree in reference to the city’s claim to be the ancestral home of the wild apple; Almaty's Soviet-era name Alma-Ata means ""Grandfather of Apples"". One of the great joys of attending the World Nomad Games is the traditional music that pours out of the concert venues and yurts of the Ethno-aul complex. The most compelling Kazakh performers are its akim, bards or storytellers who recite and improvise epic poems and histories, while playing the dombra, a Kazakh-style lute. More like this:  - Qurt: A Kazakh ""cheese of resilience""  - A road trip through Kazakhstan's immense landscapes - The five best things to do in Turkistan The musicians in the above photo are playing the dombra and accordion, the latter the legacy of the long Russian influence in the region. Alongside sport and music, the World Nomad Fames aim to preserve artistic and textile traditions through its hosting of master craftspeople, many of whom offer displays and classes in traditional Kazakh handcrafts. Bulbul Kapkyzy, pictured here with her Soviet-era Lenin carpet, is a master weaver, yurt maker and ethnographer who has been perfecting and teaching for more than 45 years. An ethnic Kazakh born in western Mongolia, she moved to Kazakhstan 20 years ago after independence, during a time of huge ethnic and economic upheaval in post-Soviet Central Asia.  Astana's ultra-modern architecture seems an unlikely location for a celebration of ancient nomadic culture. Nomads have traditionally left little architectural legacy, and Kazakhstan's futuristic capital of Astana is quickly making up for lost time. Its well-funded, cutting-edge modern architectural projects by big names such as Norman Foster give it the feel of a Central Asian Dubai, even though its location on the great steppe means that it is the world's second coldest capital city (after Mongolia's Ulaanbaatar). -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."

""The most important attribute for a kokpar player is to be strong, to be brave and to not be afraid,"" said the Kazakh team captain, Kermenbek Turganbek Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are the two great kokpar rivals and 20,000 people are expected to watch them in the final on 13 September.  Hunting with eagles is one of the more unusual of the 21 official sports featured in the Games. It takes many years for an experienced eagle hunter (known as a berkutchi) to tame and train a wild golden eagle (berkut), and the expense and time required makes it the most endangered of the Games' traditional sports. The event has three categories at the competition: hunting with eagles, hawks or falcons. All have their roots in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and western Mongolia, where the hunting of foxes, rabbits and wolves traditionally takes place in winter when the animals' fur is thickest. Wrestling on horseback (audaryspak) takes place in a 15m-diameter sandy arena and bouts are divided into six weight categories. The aim is to pull one's opponent onto the ground, but wrestlers can also get points for lifting their opponent from the saddle or pushing them out of the circle. Horses get penalised for biting. Other forms of non-horseback wrestling (known as kureshi, kurash or koresh in Turkic languages) include specific Kazakh, Turkish, Tatar and Kyrgyz styles, most of which also include female competitions, unlike many of the Games' sports. Archery (both ground and on horseback) is the sport that is perhaps most evocative of inner Asia's warrior past. For centuries waves of mounted archers overwhelmed cities across the Middle East and Eastern Europe, who were left helpless by the steppe people's unrivalled mastery of iron stirrups and composite bows. ""Chinggis [Genghis] Khan's blood is in my blood,"" said Mongolian archer Tsetsegsuren Dorjsuren. ""I feel my ancestors when I pick up my bow."" Mas-wrestling, sometimes known as stick tug of war, has its roots in Yakutiya (today's Sakha Republic, one of several Turkic republics in the Russian Federation, who attended the 2024 Games. Athletes sit facing each other with their feet on a board, both holding a wooden stick, or mas. The aim is to grab the stick from your opponent or pull your opponent over to your side (think: over-sized toddlers fighting over a toy). There are separate men's and women's competitions. The World Nomad Games is about much more than simply sport. At the heart of the half-dozen sporting venues is the Ethno-aul (aul means village in Kazakh), a collection of yurts, craft shops and local restaurants where reenactors dress as medieval warriors and musicians and perform ancient folk songs. Picture above, these women in traditional Kazakh dress stand in front of an apple tree in reference to the city’s claim to be the ancestral home of the wild apple; Almaty's Soviet-era name Alma-Ata means ""Grandfather of Apples"". One of the great joys of attending the World Nomad Games is the traditional music that pours out of the concert venues and yurts of the Ethno-aul complex. The most compelling Kazakh performers are its akim, bards or storytellers who recite and improvise epic poems and histories, while playing the dombra, a Kazakh-style lute.

Dubbed the ""Great Gathering on the Steppe"", the Olympics of the nomadic world is a spectacular celebration of traditional sports, identity and culture from across inner Asia. Part Highland Games, part Mongolian Naadam festival, and featuring sports like horseback wrestling and Central Asian strongman competitions, the World Nomad Games give a flavour of what the Olympics might have looked like if Genghis Khan had been in charge. Indeed, many of the sports have their roots in the skills required to survive on the steppe and in the unrivalled equestrian abilities that fuelled a millennium-long wave of successive steppe empires, from the Huns to the Mongols. There are traditional events such as archery and long-distance horse races, but the Games also promote Kazakh food, traditional dress and even the art of epic storytelling. The goal is to preserve and protect nomadic and steppe culture, which is under increasing threat from globalisation, modernisation and even climate change. The World Nomad Games take place every two years and shifts locations as frequently as the nomads it celebrates. The next event in 2026 will likely head back to Kyrgyzstan, where the inaugural event began in 2014. This year's competition concludes on Friday 13 September. The opening ceremony on 8 September was a spectacular affair, with 3,000 athletes from 89 countries filing into the arena, as hundreds of musicians, dancers and singers performed in front of Central Asia's political elite. The show traced the history of the Kazakh steppe from ancient Scythian warriors and Silk Road merchants to the rise of the Golden Horde and the Kazakh khanate in the 15th Century. Performers depicted scenes of the steppe convening under the symbolic embroidered panels of a yurt (pictured above), a reference to the gatherings of nomadic confederations that occurred periodically to enthrone a new khagan (ruler). This Games favourite – known variously across the region as kokpar, kok buru, ulak tartysh and buzkashi – is best described in English as rugby on horseback with a dead goat as a ball.

Dubbed the ""Great Gathering on the Steppe"", the Olympics of the nomadic world is a spectacular celebration of traditional sports, identity and culture from across inner Asia. Part Highland Games, part Mongolian Naadam festival, and featuring sports like horseback wrestling and Central Asian strongman competitions, the World Nomad Games give a flavour of what the Olympics might have looked like if Genghis Khan had been in charge. Indeed, many of the sports have their roots in the skills required to survive on the steppe and in the unrivalled equestrian abilities that fuelled a millennium-long wave of successive steppe empires, from the Huns to the Mongols. There are traditional events such as archery and long-distance horse races, but the Games also promote Kazakh food, traditional dress and even the art of epic storytelling. The goal is to preserve and protect nomadic and steppe culture, which is under increasing threat from globalisation, modernisation and even climate change. The World Nomad Games take place every two years and shifts locations as frequently as the nomads it celebrates. The next event in 2026 will likely head back to Kyrgyzstan, where the inaugural event began in 2014. This year's competition concludes on Friday 13 September. The opening ceremony on 8 September was a spectacular affair, with 3,000 athletes from 89 countries filing into the arena, as hundreds of musicians, dancers and singers performed in front of Central Asia's political elite. The show traced the history of the Kazakh steppe from ancient Scythian warriors and Silk Road merchants to the rise of the Golden Horde and the Kazakh khanate in the 15th Century. Performers depicted scenes of the steppe convening under the symbolic embroidered panels of a yurt (pictured above), a reference to the gatherings of nomadic confederations that occurred periodically to enthrone a new khagan (ruler). This Games favourite – known variously across the region as kokpar, kok buru, ulak tartysh and buzkashi – is best described in English as rugby on horseback with a dead goat as a ball. Two teams of seven horsemen compete to grab hold of the headless carcass (made of rubber for these games), hoist it under their leg, sprint for the opposition's line and then dump it in a ring of rope or a large plastic doughnut. Rough and tumble is putting it mildly; broken fingers and ripped ears are par for the course. ""The most important attribute for a kokpar player is to be strong, to be brave and to not be afraid,"" said the Kazakh team captain, Kermenbek Turganbek Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are the two great kokpar rivals and 20,000 people are expected to watch them in the final on 13 September.  Hunting with eagles is one of the more unusual of the 21 official sports featured in the Games. It takes many years for an experienced eagle hunter (known as a berkutchi) to tame and train a wild golden eagle (berkut), and the expense and time required makes it the most endangered of the Games' traditional sports. The event has three categories at the competition: hunting with eagles, hawks or falcons. All have their roots in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and western Mongolia, where the hunting of foxes, rabbits and wolves traditionally takes place in winter when the animals' fur is thickest. Wrestling on horseback (audaryspak) takes place in a 15m-diameter sandy arena and bouts are divided into six weight categories. The aim is to pull one's opponent onto the ground, but wrestlers can also get points for lifting their opponent from the saddle or pushing them out of the circle. Horses get penalised for biting. Other forms of non-horseback wrestling (known as kureshi, kurash or koresh in Turkic languages) include specific Kazakh, Turkish, Tatar and Kyrgyz styles, most of which also include female competitions, unlike many of the Games' sports. Archery (both ground and on horseback) is the sport that is perhaps most evocative of inner Asia's warrior past. For centuries waves of mounted archers overwhelmed cities across the Middle East and Eastern Europe, who were left helpless by the steppe people's unrivalled mastery of iron stirrups and composite bows. ""Chinggis [Genghis] Khan's blood is in my blood,"" said Mongolian archer Tsetsegsuren Dorjsuren. ""I feel my ancestors when I pick up my bow."" Mas-wrestling, sometimes known as stick tug of war, has its roots in Yakutiya (today's Sakha Republic, one of several Turkic republics in the Russian Federation, who attended the 2024 Games. Athletes sit facing each other with their feet on a board, both holding a wooden stick, or mas. The aim is to grab the stick from your opponent or pull your opponent over to your side (think: over-sized toddlers fighting over a toy). There are separate men's and women's competitions. The World Nomad Games is about much more than simply sport. At the heart of the half-dozen sporting venues is the Ethno-aul (aul means village in Kazakh), a collection of yurts, craft shops and local restaurants where reenactors dress as medieval warriors and musicians and perform ancient folk songs. Picture above, these women in traditional Kazakh dress stand in front of an apple tree in reference to the city’s claim to be the ancestral home of the wild apple; Almaty's Soviet-era name Alma-Ata means ""Grandfather of Apples"". One of the great joys of attending the World Nomad Games is the traditional music that pours out of the concert venues and yurts of the Ethno-aul complex. The most compelling Kazakh performers are its akim, bards or storytellers who recite and improvise epic poems and histories, while playing the dombra, a Kazakh-style lute.

https://www.bbc.com,bbc_in_article,7,1,Getty Images The four-person crew on Polaris Dawn.,First private spacewalk a success,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86l6j2w865o,"A billionaire and an engineer have become the first non-professional crew to perform one of the riskiest manoeuvres in space - a spacewalk. Jared Isaacman and Sarah Gillis stepped out of the SpaceX spacecraft around 15 minutes apart, starting at 11:52BST, wearing specially-designed suits. ""Back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here Earth sure looks like a perfect world,"" Mr Isaacman said as he exited. It was commercially funded by Mr Isaacman. Before, only astronauts with government-funded space agencies had done a spacewalk. Images broadcast live showed the two crew emerge from the white Dragon capsule to float 435 miles (700km) above the blue Earth below. Mr Isaacman emerged first, wiggling his limbs, hands and feet to test his suit. He returned back inside the hatch, and Ms Gillis, who works for SpaceX, then climbed out. Both crew narrated their spacewalk, describing how their suits performed outside of the craft. The walk, originally scheduled for 07:23BST, was postponed early on Thursday. Anticipation and tension grew as the crew prepared to open the hatch on the craft that has no air lock, or doorway between the vacuum outside and the rest of the spacecraft. The four crew members spent two days “pre-breathing” to prevent becoming seriously ill from decompression sickness, known as getting “the bends”, as the pressure changed. That involves replacing nitrogen in the blood with oxygen. The craft was then depressurised to bring it closer to the conditions of the space vacuum outside. This type of space walk took a “very different approach” to previous walks from, for example, the International Space Station, according to Dr Simeon Barber, research scientist at the Open University.  In recent decades astronauts used an airlock that separates most of a craft from the space vacuum outside - but this SpaceX Dragon capsule was in effect entirely exposed to space outside. “It's really exciting and I think it shows again that SpaceX is not afraid to do things in a different way,” he told BBC News. But it was not without major risks. Mr Isaacman, who funded the Polaris Dawn mission, was the only member of the four-person crew on the Polaris mission to have previously been to space. He is commander on the Resilience spacecraft with his close friend Scott 'Kidd' Poteet, who is a retired air force pilot, and two SpaceX engineers Anna Menon and Sarah Gillis. The Dragon capsule the team have flown in launched to space 46 times before, taking 50 crew in total. However, the capsule and the spacesuits are not subject to regulation and were untested in this environment. Spacewalks are one of the most difficult manouevres in space, so the fact that a private company has pulled it off is a milestone in the history of space travel. This walk at 435 miles (700km) was higher than any previous walk, and used innovative technology in the new extravehicular activity (EVA) astronaut suits. These are an upgrade from SpaceX’s previous intravehicular activity (IVA) suits. The EVA suit incorporates a heads-up display in its helmet, which provides information about the suit while it is being used. Sarah Gillis read out data from her heads-up display during her time outside the Dragon capsule. SpaceX say the suits are comfortable and flexible enough to be worn during launch and landing, eliminating the need to have separate IVA suits. Extra nitrogen and oxygen tanks were installed and all four astronauts wore the suits, meaning the mission broke the record for the most people in the vacuum of space at once. The Resilience spacecraft left Earth on Tuesday on a SpaceX rocket. The mission said it would travel up to 870 miles (1,400km) up in orbit - further than any human has been in space since Nasa's Apollo programme ended in the 1970s. Government space agencies like Nasa want the private sector to transport their astronauts on missions and bring down the cost of space travel. And entrepreneurs like Isaacman and Elon Musk want to expand private space travel so that more non-professional astronauts can go to space.  This is a major symbolic step forwards, but that day is probably a long way off as the costs remain prohibitively high. "

https://www.bbc.com,bbc_in_article,8,1,Getty Images File photo of a Muslim girl looking at the pond,Police rescue 402 minors in care homes after abuse claims,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62r2dk5ekgo,"Malaysian police have rescued 402 children and teenagers that they suspect were physically and sexually abused across 20 care homes.  Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual and physical violence. The victims, aged between one to 17, were said to have endured various forms of abuse, with some allegedly forced to perform sexual acts on other children, said Police Inspector-General Razarudin Husain at a press conference. Police have arrested 171 suspects, including religious teachers and caretakers.  The care homes are allegedly linked to a prominent Islamic conglomerate which has issued a statement denying any wrongdoing.  Police raids on Wednesday across 20 welfare homes in the states of Selangor and Negeri Sembilan were prompted by reports earlier this month of child exploitation, molestation and sexual abuse at another facility in Negeri Sembilan state. At a press conference on Wednesday, Insp Razarudin told reporters that some of the suspects - aged between 17 to 64 - would allegedly touch the children, claiming it was part of a religious treatment. Some children were also reportedly taught to perform similar sexual acts on other children at the home.  Children were also ""punished using heated metal objects"" and those who were ill were not allowed to seek medical treatment until their condition turned critical, he added.  The children will be temporarily housed at a police centre in the capital Kuala Lumpur and will undergo health checks, said Insp Razarudin.  Initial investigations found that many children were placed in these homes by their parents so they could undergo religious education, according to state news agency Bernama.  The raids come days after police opened an investigation against the Islamic Global Ikhwan Group (GISB) business group over child exploitation. The police has since confirmed that the two cases are linked. Deputy Inspector-General of Police Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said initial investigations have revealed that GISB's modus operandi is to set up welfare homes to collection donations, said a report by the New Straits Times. The group denied the allegations in a statement posted to Facebook on Wednesday.  ""The company will not compromise with any activity that goes against the law, particularly regarding the exploitation of children,"" it said. GISB has hundreds of businesses across 20 countries, operating across sectors from hospitality, to food, to education. The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, or Suhakam, has called for stricter regulations in welfare homes.  ""The problem is that these places are not properly regulated or supervised,"" Suhakam's children's commissioner Farah Nini Dusuki told online news site Free Malaysia Today. ""We have a serious issue with monitoring and supervision, which is why we need the community to be more alert,"" she said.

He was being treated for an acute respiratory tract infection at a Delhi hospital where he was admitted on 19 August. Yechury, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M), was a key figure in India's politics over several decades. Several politicians including main opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and former rival Mamata Banerjee have paid their tributes. Yechury started his political career as a student leader with the left-wing Student Federation of India. He was arrested during the Emergency in 1975, when the Congress government led by Indira Gandhi enforced a widespread curtailment of civil liberties.  After his release, he went on to become the president of Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, where he studied economics. He played an especially significant role during the peak years of coalition politics, when the stability of India's federal governments depended on bringing together disparate ideologies and priorities. In 1996, he played a leading role in forming a coalition of 13 parties, which governed India for nearly two years with two prime ministers - HD Deve Gowda and IK Gujral - sharing the tenure. In 2004, Yechury's party won a historic 44 seats in the parliamentary election. The Left parties, including the CPI(M), then supported the Congress-led government from “outside” - a term used for supporting the administration without taking ministerial roles. But in 2008, they withdrew their support as a protest against the Indo-US nuclear deal, which required India to place its civil nuclear facilities under the watch of the International Atomic Energy Agency in exchange for full civil nuclear co-operation with the United States. The Left’s decision was controversial and seen by many as questionable as it failed to repeat its 2004 electoral success. By the time Yechury became the CPI(M)'s general secretary in 2015, the party had lost many of its former strongholds, including West Bengal state, and its parliamentary seats were on the decline. He was a member of the Rajya Sabha, or the upper house of parliament, from 2005 to 2017. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, with whom Yechury shared a warm relationship, called him a ""friend"" while paying his tribute. ""A protector of the Idea of India with a deep understanding of our country. I will miss the long discussions we used to have,"" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Mamata Banerjee, whose Trinamool Congress ended the Left's 34-year-old rule in West Bengal in 2011, called his death ""a loss for national politics""."
https://www.bbc.com,bbc_in_article,10,1,Getty Images Donald Trump after the 10 September US presidential debate,Ohio leaders dismiss claims of migrants eating pets,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj35kk42k5vo,"Leaders in the US state of Ohio are trying to douse baseless rumours that Haitian immigrants in a town there have been eating residents' pets as food. The allegations have percolated up through right-wing media and were amplified by Donald Trump at his presidential debate with Kamala Harris on Tuesday. ""This is something that came up on the internet, and the internet can be quite crazy sometimes,"" Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said. On Tuesday, a parent in the town of Springfield accused Republicans of politically exploiting his son's death in a crash caused by a Haitian migrant. Authorities say some 15,000 migrants of Haitian origin have resettled over the past couple of years in Springfield, a south-western Ohio town with a population of less than 60,000 people. Some local residents have expressed frustration over the influx, saying the new residents are  straining city resources, from housing to healthcare. But the criticisms have taken a turn in recent weeks amid unsubstantiated claims on social media that the new migrants are abducting and eating animals, from pet cats and dogs to park ducks. Trump, his running mate JD Vance, the world's richest man Elon Musk and other conservatives have amplified the reports. Local officials have cast doubt on the viral stories. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue said on Tuesday that ""we have not been able to verify any credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community"". ""The news story regarding a cat being killed or consumed did not originate in Springfield,"" he added. ""It actually involved a Canton woman who was arrested for animal cruelty last month."" Canton is an Ohio city north-east of Springfield. ""I think we go with what the mayor says,"" Governor DeWine told CBS on Wednesday. ""He knows his city."" A moderate Republican who has endorsed Trump's re-election bid, DeWine has pledged to invest in Springfield's healthcare and education systems to address its ""unprecedented"" population increase, but he also defended the newcomers. ""These Haitians came in here to work because there were jobs, and they filled a lot of jobs. And if you talk to employers, they've done a very, very good job and they work very, very hard,"" he said. Tensions in Springfield are rising, and on Thursday officials closed city hall following reports of a bomb threat. It is not yet known whether the threat was connected to the immigration controversy. ""As a precautionary measure, the building has been evacuated, and authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation,"" the mayor's office said on Facebook. Concerns over public safety rose last August after a Haitian immigrant driving without a valid US licence crashed his minivan into a school bus. One student - Aiden Clark, 11 - died after being thrown from the bus as it flipped, while 20 others were sent to the hospital. The driver, Hermanio Joseph, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and felony vehicular homicide, and sentenced to nine to 13-and-a-half years in prison. On Monday, the Trump campaign's X account posted side-by-side photos of Clark and Joseph, and attacked Vice-President Harris' immigration policies before the presidential debate. ""REMEMBER: 11-year-old Aiden Clark was killed on his way to school by a Haitian migrant that Kamala Harris let into the country in Springfield, Ohio,"" the caption read.  At a city commission meeting later the same day, Aiden's father, Nathan, said he wished his child had been killed ""by a 60-year-old white man"" so ""the incessant group of hate-spewing people would leave us alone"". The Trump campaign told the BBC it was ""deeply sorry to the Clark family for the loss of their son"".  ""We hope the media will continue to cover the stories of the very real suffering and tragedies experienced by the people of Springfield, Ohio, due to the influx of illegal Haitian immigrants in their community,"" the campaign said. Just a few hours after Mr Clark spoke, Trump repeated the claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets in a primetime TV debate watched by more than 67 million viewers."
