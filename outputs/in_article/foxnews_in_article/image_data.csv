https://www.foxnews.com/,foxnews_in_article,3,1,Boise State QB throws,Pac-12 revival: Conference is poaching four teams from Mountain West in massive realignment move,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/pac-12-revival-conference-poaching-four-teams-from-mountain-west-massive-realignment-move,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. After the mass exodus that we witnessed last year, the Pac-12 has risen from the ashes, putting together a plan that will add four teams from the Mountain West Conference in another round of realignment that will bring the once left-for-dead league back to the table in college athletics.  After shouting from the rooftops that the Pac-12 could still play a factor in the future, and that just because ten teams decided to leave for greener pastures, the conference is putting a whole new band together.  How’s that song go?  'Gather round this table, boys. Bring your shame, I'll lose my voice'. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Following the realignment that seemingly left the conference hanging on by a thread, with 10 schools deciding to head elsewhere led by Oregon, Washington, USC and UCLA, the long-thought out plan of keeping the Pac-12 brand alive is coming to fruition.  It was officially announced on Thursday morning by the Pac-12.  FILE - This Thursday, Aug. 29, 2019, file photo, shows the Pac-12 logo during the second half of an NCAA college football game between Arizona State and Kent State, in Tempe, Ariz. (AP Photo/Ralph Freso, File) ""For over a century, the Pac-12 Conference has been recognized as a leading brand in intercollegiate athletics,"" Commissioner Teresa Gould stated. ""We will continue to pursue bold cutting-edge opportunities for growth and progress, to best serve our member institutions and student-athletes. I am thankful to our board for their efforts to welcome Boise State University, Colorado State University, California State University, Fresno, and San Diego State University to the conference.  An exciting new era for the Pac-12 Conference begins today."" As first reported by Yahoo Sports, and confirmed by OutKick from multiple sources, the conference that currently only consists of Washington State and Oregon State is making their move to bring in four teams from the Mountain West. This move would put them at six schools. The plan is to have Fresno State, Colorado State, Boise State and San Diego State apply to join the conference, which would then be approved by the current two schools. It certainly didn't help the Mountain West conference when they could not come to an agreement with the Pac-12 on a future scheduling model, with the deadline already passing earlier this month.  Sources tell OutKick that the missed deadline gave the Pac-12 conference the perfect incentive to make a move on Mountain West schools.  This move would set the foundation for the Pac-12 to remain an FBS conference that is recognized by the NCAA, with an additional two teams needed to meet the requirements of eight institutions. The schools that plan to leave the Mountain West conference would then begin playing in the ‘new’ Pac-12 starting in 2026.  Right now, the Pac-12 is working under a ‘grace period’ provided by the NCAA that maintains their status as an FBS conference, but that period will end in 2026. The move to poach enough teams to solidify the Pac-12 has always been the hope from the two remaining schools, as the brand still carries enough weight when it comes to history and tradition, with the conference name alone being a staple-point of college athletics.  FOX NEWS DIGITAL SPORTS' COLLEGE FOOTBALL WINNERS AND LOSERS: WEEK 2 Boise State quarterback Maddux Madsen throws down field for a second quarter touchdown against Oregon at Autzen Stadium in Eugene Sept. 7, 2024. (Chris Pietsch/The Register-Guard / USA TODAY NETWORK) Now, the schools that are looking to leave the Mountain West conference will have to pay $17 million, along with an additional $43 million that is part of a scheduling agreement.

Will we see the geographic moves that we witnessed in the latest round of realignment, like Cal and Stanford joining the ACC? I would say that it could be a possibility, if the financial situation is right, for any school looking to leave their current conference, like the AAC or Sun Belt, just for reference.  In the grand scheme of things, this would be a major move for the Pac-12, given the ever-changing landscape of college athletics, and the pending revenue-sharing model that is currently being litigated in a courtroom.  Since the departures of the ten previous conference schools, the CFP committee took away the Pac-12's automatic bid, and made it an ‘at-large’ spot. But, the opportunity for the conference to get back an automatic bid to the college football playoff would be a very big deal for schools looking to join in the next two years.  We are certainly not done with realignment in college sports, and the Pac-12 is looking to rise from the ashes of what was a premier conference in college athletics.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The conference will obviously not look the same when it comes to the pedigree of its potential future teams, but the conference name is still alive, and it's starting to look like we'll be getting ‘Pac-12 After Dark’ back.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. After the mass exodus that we witnessed last year, the Pac-12 has risen from the ashes, putting together a plan that will add four teams from the Mountain West Conference in another round of realignment that will bring the once left-for-dead league back to the table in college athletics.  After shouting from the rooftops that the Pac-12 could still play a factor in the future, and that just because ten teams decided to leave for greener pastures, the conference is putting a whole new band together.  How’s that song go?  'Gather round this table, boys. Bring your shame, I'll lose my voice'. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Following the realignment that seemingly left the conference hanging on by a thread, with 10 schools deciding to head elsewhere led by Oregon, Washington, USC and UCLA, the long-thought out plan of keeping the Pac-12 brand alive is coming to fruition.  It was officially announced on Thursday morning by the Pac-12.  FILE - This Thursday, Aug. 29, 2019, file photo, shows the Pac-12 logo during the second half of an NCAA college football game between Arizona State and Kent State, in Tempe, Ariz.

""We will continue to pursue bold cutting-edge opportunities for growth and progress, to best serve our member institutions and student-athletes. I am thankful to our board for their efforts to welcome Boise State University, Colorado State University, California State University, Fresno, and San Diego State University to the conference.  An exciting new era for the Pac-12 Conference begins today."" As first reported by Yahoo Sports, and confirmed by OutKick from multiple sources, the conference that currently only consists of Washington State and Oregon State is making their move to bring in four teams from the Mountain West. This move would put them at six schools. The plan is to have Fresno State, Colorado State, Boise State and San Diego State apply to join the conference, which would then be approved by the current two schools. It certainly didn't help the Mountain West conference when they could not come to an agreement with the Pac-12 on a future scheduling model, with the deadline already passing earlier this month.  Sources tell OutKick that the missed deadline gave the Pac-12 conference the perfect incentive to make a move on Mountain West schools.  This move would set the foundation for the Pac-12 to remain an FBS conference that is recognized by the NCAA, with an additional two teams needed to meet the requirements of eight institutions. The schools that plan to leave the Mountain West conference would then begin playing in the ‘new’ Pac-12 starting in 2026.  Right now, the Pac-12 is working under a ‘grace period’ provided by the NCAA that maintains their status as an FBS conference, but that period will end in 2026. The move to poach enough teams to solidify the Pac-12 has always been the hope from the two remaining schools, as the brand still carries enough weight when it comes to history and tradition, with the conference name alone being a staple-point of college athletics.  FOX NEWS DIGITAL SPORTS' COLLEGE FOOTBALL WINNERS AND LOSERS: WEEK 2 Boise State quarterback Maddux Madsen throws down field for a second quarter touchdown against Oregon at Autzen Stadium in Eugene Sept. 7, 2024.

Attorneys representing the father of suspected Apalachee High School shooter Colt Gray are now asking a court for him to be separated from other inmates to ""ensure his personal safety.""  Lawyers for Colin Gray, who is facing four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree murder and eight counts of second-degree cruelty to children in connection to the Sept. 4 attack in Winder, Georgia, made the request in a filing Wednesday with Barrow County Superior Court, according to WRDW. He is being held at the Barrow County Detention Center without bond.  ""As a result of the coverage, the public perception as discerned through both the local and national media, and most notably, social media, has led to a nonstop barrage of information being transmitted to the public, leading to incalculable number of threats against the Defendant and calling for both harm and violence to befall the Defendant, and in some cases, even calling for death of the Defendant,"" the 54-year-old's attorneys wrote in a copy of the filing obtained by the station.  They said that ""so many lives in the community of Barrow County have been touched in unfathomable ways, it would be reckless to assume there are NO inmates, either currently or in the near future, being housed in the Barrow County Detention Center, who wish harm to the Defendant,"" the lawyers continued.  GEORGIA SCHOOL SHOOTING: AUTHORITIES REVEAL HOW SUSPECT BROUGHT GUN INTO BUILDING  Colin Gray, 54, the father of Apalachee High School shooter Colt Gray, 14, enters the Barrow County courthouse for his first appearance, on Friday, Sept. 6, 2024, in Winder, Ga.  (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) ""Furthermore, due to both the custodial setting and the non-stop, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, nature of supervision necessary in such a custodial environment, with such a high profile defendant, opportunities abound for individuals to visit such violence upon the Defendant,"" they said.  GEORGIA HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTING SUSPECT’S MOM DEFENDS HER SON IN MESSAGE TO VICTIMS’ FAMILIES  A memorial is seen at Apalachee High School after the school shooting, on Saturday, Sept. 7, in Winder, Ga.   (AP Photo/Mike Stewart) ""As a result of all of the above, the Defendant would move this court to Order the Sheriff of Barrow County to keep the Defendant separate from all other inmates in order to ensure his personal safety.""  The Barrow County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.  Colin Gray, 54, the father of Apalachee High School shooter Colt Gray, is facing multiple charges in connection with the attack.

Idaho's Supreme Court has assigned Bryan Kohberger's upcoming student murders trial to a judge in Ada County after his defense team successfully sought a change of venue to take the proceedings away from rural Latah County, where he is accused of killing four college students. A one-page order signed by Idaho's Chief Justice Richard Bevan assigned District Judge Steven Hippler to the case. Latah County District Judge John Judge granted the defense's request for a change of venue last week, citing a number of factors that he said collectively were in favor of moving the trial to a larger courthouse, further removed from the location of the crime.

The change of venue could impact scheduling surrounding the trial, which is expected to begin next June after prior delays, according to Edwina Elcox, a Boise-based defense attorney who previously represented another high-profile Idaho murder suspect, the ""cult mom"" Lori Vallow.

Prosecutors sought to have the trial held at the courthouse in Moscow, next to the jail where the 29-year-old Kohberger has been held without bail since shortly after his arrest in Pennsylvania at his parents' house, roughly seven weeks after the Nov. 13, 2022 slayings.

San Bernadino County Judge Michael Sachs issued a preliminary injunction against the policy last year, and the court has now formally struck down most of the plan. The judge allowed part of the policy that required parental notification if a student's name or pronoun is formally changed in the school's records. The ruling comes more than a month after California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation that prevented schools from implementing notification requirements in July.

FIRST ON FOX -- A prominent pro-life group isn’t happy with ABC News over its hosting of Tuesday’s presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump.  Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America sent a letter to ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic and debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis on Wednesday that urges them to issue a correction and meet with abortion survivors over a viral moment where Davis fact-checked Trump. ""[The] ABC News Presidential Debate featured network moderator Linsey Davis attempting to debunk former President Trump's assertion that some states allow for the killing of an infant after birth,"" Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America president Marjorie Dannenfelser wrote in the letter obtained by Fox News Digital.  ABC’S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF' ABC Presidential Debate co-moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis (ABC News) During the debate, Trump referred to infamous comments made by former Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam in 2019 but was promptly ""fact-checked"" by Davis. At the time, Northam suggested that in those rare instances of third-trimester abortions, a baby could be born alive and a ""discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother."" ""The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,"" Northam said in 2019. Trump's apparent reference to Northam at the debate drew a quick rebuke from Davis. ""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born,"" Davis said.  Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America claims the ABC moderator was ""inaccurate"" and should correct the record.  ""This is 100% inaccurate. Her statement tragically ignores the reality of babies who survive failed, late-term abortions but are denied basic medical care and left to die,"" Dannenfelser wrote. ""We are writing to request a swift correction from Ms. Davis and ABC News. It is undeniable that babies are born in this country after failed abortions, as the facts below demonstrate,"" she continued. ""A correction from the network and the debate moderators is an important first step in acknowledging this fact. We also encourage ABC to meet with abortion survivors who are a living testament to the need for born-alive protections."" VOTERS GIVE HARRIS THE DEBATE WIN, BUT PRAISE TRUMP ON POLICY: SHE GOT UNDER HIS SKIN A prominent pro-life group isn’t pleased with ABC News debate moderator Linsey Davis over a fact-check of former President Trump. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) The pro-life advocate then added several claims to back up the request for a correction, including ""numerous examples of babies born alive after failed abortions"" and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that ""between 2003 and 2014, around 143 babies died after being born alive following failed abortions.""  It also cited a report from the center-right outlet The Dispatch about Minnesota recording eight deaths among infants who survived abortion attempts during Tim Walz’s tenure as governor. ""It’s also a fact that, as a U.S. senator, Kamala Harris voted against protections for babies born alive after failed abortions. And as a member of Congress, her running mate Tim Walz even issued a public apology for ‘accidentally’ voting for said legislation after he previously voted against it,"" Dannenfelser wrote. The Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life president requested an in-person meeting with ABC honchos to speak directly with abortion survivors.  Numerous fact-checks published after the debate slammed Trump for his remarks on abortion. ""Infanticide is illegal in every state, and Harris and Walz have never supported it,"" CBS News reported. NPR also cited a Kaiser Family Foundation report earlier this year that stated abortions ""after birth"" are illegal in all 50 states. At the debate, Harris dodged a question from Davis over whether she supported any restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion.  ""I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe v. Wade,"" Harris said. ""And as you rightly mentioned, nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not happening.""

FIRST ON FOX -- A prominent pro-life group isn’t happy with ABC News over its hosting of Tuesday’s presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump.  Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America sent a letter to ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic and debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis on Wednesday that urges them to issue a correction and meet with abortion survivors over a viral moment where Davis fact-checked Trump. ""[The] ABC News Presidential Debate featured network moderator Linsey Davis attempting to debunk former President Trump's assertion that some states allow for the killing of an infant after birth,"" Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America president Marjorie Dannenfelser wrote in the letter obtained by Fox News Digital.  ABC’S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF' ABC Presidential Debate co-moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis (ABC News) During the debate, Trump referred to infamous comments made by former Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam in 2019 but was promptly ""fact-checked"" by Davis. At the time, Northam suggested that in those rare instances of third-trimester abortions, a baby could be born alive and a ""discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother."" ""The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,"" Northam said in 2019. Trump's apparent reference to Northam at the debate drew a quick rebuke from Davis. ""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born,"" Davis said.  Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America claims the ABC moderator was ""inaccurate"" and should correct the record.  ""This is 100% inaccurate. Her statement tragically ignores the reality of babies who survive failed, late-term abortions but are denied basic medical care and left to die,"" Dannenfelser wrote. ""We are writing to request a swift correction from Ms. Davis and ABC News. It is undeniable that babies are born in this country after failed abortions, as the facts below demonstrate,"" she continued. ""A correction from the network and the debate moderators is an important first step in acknowledging this fact. We also encourage ABC to meet with abortion survivors who are a living testament to the need for born-alive protections.""
