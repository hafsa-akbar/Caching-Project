Illia “Golem” Yefimchyk’s death last week was confirmed Wednesday by the Instagram account @whoisthebestbb. The athlete allegedly suffered a heart attack at home on Sept. 6 and fell into a coma, the Daily Mail reported, citing Belarusian and Russian media. His wife, Anna, supposedly performed chest compressions on him while they waited for the ambulance. “I spent every day by his side, hoping, and his heart started beating again for two days, but the doctor gave me the terrible news that his brain had died,” the grieving widow told the local media. “I thank everyone for their condolences. It’s very heartwarming to realize that I am not left alone in this world, and so many people have offered me help and support.” Yefimchyk was dubbed “The Mutant” by the bodybuilding world for his staggering 6-foot, 340-pound frame, Muscle and Fitness reported. The disciplined athlete claimed that he maintained 25-inch biceps through a “mass monster” diet of up to 16,500 calories per day. His seven daily meals supposedly included over five pounds of steak and more than 100 pieces of sushi. Yefimchyk did not compete in professional bodybuilding, but shared his workouts online, where he had over 100,000 followers across all platforms. He was supposedly inspired to start lifting weights after seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stalone at their physical peaks, Muscle and Fitness said. Yefimchyk claimed he could perform a 600-pound bench press, a 700-pound deadlift, and 700-pound squats. News of Yefimchyk’s death comes not long after the deaths of British bodybuilder Neil Currey, 34, and Brazilian competitor Antonio Souza, 26. Currey was found dead in his apartment in September 2023. His parents blamed his passing on prolonged steroid use, the BBC reported. Souza died from cardiac arrest shortly after he finished in the top 3 at a competition on Aug. 3, UNILAD said. "

https://nypost.com/,nypost_in_article,2,1,Donald Trump and Kamala Harris debate,"Trump-Harris debate confirmed what we know: He’s combative, she’s dishonest",https://nypost.com/2024/09/11/opinion/trump-harris-debate-confirmed-what-we-know-hes-combative-shes-dishonest/,"Donald Trump was angry. Kamala Harris was preachy. The moderators were on her side. Tuesday night’s debate between Trump and Harris was never going to be enlightening, given these two candidates. It wasn’t Lincoln and Douglas. But it did put on display who they both are. Trump was belligerent. He bragged about his accomplishments and the things he thinks he would have done if he was re-elected — which he still claims he was. He was unapologetic about every bad thing he’s ever done. When baited into talking about January 6 and his 2020 stolen election theories, he gladly walked into the trap. He peddled a deeply dubious story about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating pet cats and dogs. But he was also vigorous and combative, dispelling any concerns about his advanced age. He returned again and again and again to his favorite themes: out-of-control immigration, the economy getting worse under President Biden and Harris than it was on his watch, foreigners taking advantage of America on trade, and the eruption of foreign wars under Biden and Harris that wouldn’t have happened under Trump. Nobody came away wondering what Trump thinks are the most important issues of the day. It’s harder to say that for Harris, except on abortion. Was this a good night for Trump? He probably did nothing to change anyone’s view of him, other than possibly reassuring people worried about his age. He glowered and ranted. He seemed like the same old bull in a china shop he was nine years ago, both for better and for worse. The microphones being off prevented him from interrupting Harris — he even mocked her desire to be interrupted by quipping that he was talking. Trump’s number one job was to convince voters of two things: that Harris would be a continuance of failed Biden policies, and that she was too left-wing. On the first goal, he largely succeeded. He referred again and again to Biden as “her boss,” challenged her — without a response — to part company with him, and called on her to explain why her campaign promises hadn’t been done already. On the second goal, he had mixed success, as moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis of ABC repeatedly changed the subject when things got uncomfortable for Harris on her past record. They tried to “fact-check” Trump several times, but never attempted the same for Harris — even when she baldly denied her own prior record. Harris really does support abortion until the moment of birth, and her party (including her running mate) really does resist care for babies born alive after botched abortions. She really did run for president in 2020 on confiscating guns, banning fracking and abolishing private health insurance. The moderators shouldn’t have worked so hard to shelter her from facing those critiques. Was this a good night for Harris? She probably didn’t persuade anyone to vote against Trump with a lot of well-worn attacks, but given that he’s never yet cracked 47% of the vote nationwide, she may not have to. Far more important was selling herself. On the upside, Harris avoided the sort of rambling word salads that have made her the butt of Washington humor for years. She stuck to her script as much as possible, and that included talking more about Trump than about herself and Biden. That’s a win. For all her vaunted reputation as a prosecutor, however, Harris could only recite Trump’s legal rap sheet rather than actually try to explain why the law ought to be after him. But a lot of what Harris did in chiding Trump just reminded people that official Washington and the establishment hate him. Goldman Sachs and Nobel Prize-winning economists dislike his economic plans. John McCain stopped him from repealing Obamacare. The Cheneys are against him, and so is the military brass. People who worked for him came away disillusioned. In an America that had more faith in these institutions, this would sting. But such an America would never have elected Trump the first time. What’s scandalous is what never came up at all. Harris was never asked about her support for a Supreme Court “term limits” plan that appears aimed at forcing three conservative justices off the bench to pack the court. She got away with embracing Israel’s “right to defend itself” without mentioning her side’s embrace of pro-Hamas protesters, or explaining how her one-sided pressure on Israel would constrict its options to purely defensive responses, even in the face of massacres. Whenever Trump was gaining momentum, the moderators switched to a topic such as abortion or climate change that sent Harris to her happy place. In a polarized country, this is the sort of debate that sends partisans back to their corners. Unlike Biden’s flameout in June, it’s unlikely to seriously reset the race. If you really want to know who lost, watch which side wants a rematch. Dan McLaughlin is a senior writer at National Review."
https://nypost.com/,nypost_in_article,3,1,"Prior to popping open the hatch and emerging, Isaacman and his three crew members were spotted waiting inside until the capsule was completely depressurized.  ",Tech billionaire Jared Isaacman steps out in space for first-ever private spacewalk after traveling farther than any man has gone in 50 years,https://nypost.com/2024/09/12/us-news/tech-billionaire-jared-isaacman-conducting-first-ever-private-spacewalk/,"Tech billionaire Jared Isaacman became the first-ever civilian to embark on a spacewalk early Thursday — after already traveling the farthest from Earth a human being has gone since the Apollo moon missions. Footage of the daring stunt showed Isaacman, 41, popping out of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule on a tether as he came face-to-face with the dark vacuum of space just before 7 a.m. “Back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here, Earth sure looks like a perfect world,” Isaacman said soon after emerging from the spacecraft. Cameras on board captured his silhouette, waist high at the hatch, with the Earth glittering below him in a half-shadow. After about 15 minutes outside, Isaacman was replaced by SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis to go through the same motions. Their maneuvers were streamed live on SpaceX’s website for the duration of the two-hour spacewalk. Prior to popping open the hatch and emerging, Isaacman and his three other crewmembers were spotted waiting inside as the capsule was completely depressurized.   During that time, they relied on their newly developed SpaceX spacewalking suits for oxygen, which was provided via an umbilical connection to Crew Dragon. The crew were all connected to 12-foot tethers but didn’t completely unfurl them during the spacewalk. After emerging, Isaacman — the billionaire CEO and founder of the credit card processing company Shift4 — could be seen keeping a hand or foot attached to the capsule’s hatch at all times as he flexed his arms and legs. Gillis, meanwhile, bobbed up and down as she twisted her arms and sent live reports back to Mission Control. A longer, untethered spacewalk – which is common at the International Space Station – wasn’t possible because only NASA suits are currently equipped with jetpacks that can guide an astronaut back to safety. Given the Crew Dragon doesn’t have a pressurized airlock, the crew needed to wear the new spacesuits to protect them from the vacuum conditions during the mission. It comes after SpaceX had delayed the planned start of the spacewalk by a few hours early Thursday. No explanation was immediately given for the delay, but the company said via X that “all systems are looking good.” Isaacman and Gillis were joined on the mission by fellow SpaceX engineer Anna Menon and former Air Force Thunderbirds pilot, Scott “Kidd” Poteet. They began preparing for the endeavor soon after blasting into orbit on Tuesday for a five-day flight. The spacewalk took place after Isaacman and the crew reached a distance of nearly 870 miles above the Earth — well beyond the International Space Station and surpassing the Earth-lapping record set during NASA’s Project Gemini in 1966.       Only the 24 Apollo mission astronauts who flew to the moon have ventured farther into space.  While the trip would normally be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, it is just the first of three trips Isaacman purchased from Elon Musk in 2022. Isaacman, who has not publicly stated how much his SpaceX trips cost, was among the first group of tourists who flew to space in 2021. They began preparing for the endeavor soon after blasting into orbit on Tuesday for a five-day flight. During that trip, Isaacman set a record by being the first space tourist to circle the Earth without having a professional astronaut aboard.  With Post wires"

Footage of the daring stunt showed Isaacman, 41, popping out of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule on a tether as he came face-to-face with the dark vacuum of space just before 7 a.m. “Back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here, Earth sure looks like a perfect world,” Isaacman said soon after emerging from the spacecraft. Cameras on board captured his silhouette, waist high at the hatch, with the Earth glittering below him in a half-shadow. After about 15 minutes outside, Isaacman was replaced by SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis to go through the same motions. Their maneuvers were streamed live on SpaceX’s website for the duration of the two-hour spacewalk. Prior to popping open the hatch and emerging, Isaacman and his three other crewmembers were spotted waiting inside as the capsule was completely depressurized.   During that time, they relied on their newly developed SpaceX spacewalking suits for oxygen, which was provided via an umbilical connection to Crew Dragon. The crew were all connected to 12-foot tethers but didn’t completely unfurl them during the spacewalk. After emerging, Isaacman — the billionaire CEO and founder of the credit card processing company Shift4 — could be seen keeping a hand or foot attached to the capsule’s hatch at all times as he flexed his arms and legs. Gillis, meanwhile, bobbed up and down as she twisted her arms and sent live reports back to Mission Control. A longer, untethered spacewalk – which is common at the International Space Station – wasn’t possible because only NASA suits are currently equipped with jetpacks that can guide an astronaut back to safety. Given the Crew Dragon doesn’t have a pressurized airlock, the crew needed to wear the new spacesuits to protect them from the vacuum conditions during the mission. It comes after SpaceX had delayed the planned start of the spacewalk by a few hours early Thursday.

The 17-year-old boy told authorities that he and a friend hopped the fence at a home in Conifer, about 30 miles southwest of Denver, and walked up the driveway on Tuesday in hopes of speaking with the homeowner about using their property for homecoming photos, the Colorado Sun reported.  When they were unable to find the homeowner, they returned to their car and began writing a note to ask about using the property for a photoshoot.  Moments later, a truck pulled up next to them on the road. Its driver, Brent Metz, 38, got out and shot at the boys through their car’s windshield, striking one of the boys in the face, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said in a release.  Police were called to the home by the homeowner who reported two trespassers, and found the boy “bleeding heavily from his face” as his friend applied pressure to the wound with a T-shirt.  Metz, the homeowner’s boyfriend and a member of the Mountain View Town Council, was called to the home by his girlfriend, who wasn’t home but saw the teens on her security system, according to the outlet. Officers found the note written by the teens on the scene, which confirmed their story, CBS News reported.  According to an arrest report obtained by CBS, the teen didn’t think Metz had shot him intentionally.  The teen “heard the driver (Brent) say ‘Oh s–t, my gun went off,'” according to the arrest report.  He also told authorities that Metz tried to help after he fired the round, but the other boy, who is 15 and a childhood friend of the victim, pushed him away and “asked why he shot his friend.”  Officers found Metz’s gun inside his truck and he was standing next to the boys when officers arrived, according to the release.  The sheriff’s department did not say what kind of gun was used in the shooting.  Metz is a Mountain View Town Council member, according to the town’s website. He was sworn in last year in the town of just over 500 residents. His term is set to expire in 2027. He was arrested and booked in jail on charges of first-degree assault, felony menacing, illegal discharge of a firearm and reckless endangerment.

https://nypost.com/,nypost_in_article,5,1,Trump has repeatedly said he wasn’t involved in writing project 2025.,Here’s the fact check that ABC didn’t give Kamala Harris,https://nypost.com/2024/09/11/opinion/heres-the-fact-check-that-abc-didnt-give-kamala-harris/,"During Tuesday night’s debate, ABC News moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis interrupted Donald Trump five times to “fact-check” his answers. They did the same to Kamala Harris … never. The vice president was allowed to skate through the debate without substantive follow-up questions or pushback on some of her obviously false claims. So since ABC didn’t do its job, here are some of the fact checks they should have made: Kamala claim: “As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.” Fact check: Our troops in Middle East are absolutely in a combat zone, under attack from Iran, which the Biden-Harris administration has allowed to grow more aggressive in its use of proxies. In January this year, three US soldiers in Jordan were killed by a drone attack from an Iran-aligned group, and dozens of others have been wounded in similar strikes. Kamala claim: “What you’re going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again.” Fact check: The Heritage Foundation, an independent think tank, produced Project 2025, not the Trump campaign. Trump has repeatedly said he wasn’t involved in its writing, does not believe in its policies and won’t implement it. Kamala claim: “Let’s remember, this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for the execution of five young black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five. Took out a full-page ad calling for their execution.” Fact check: Trump’s 1989 advertisement did not call for the execution of the Central Park Five. He talked about a woman raped in the park, but did not mention the names of suspects or who they were. Titled “Bring Back the Death Penalty. Bring Back the Police,” Trump simply bemoaned how generally unsafe New York City had become, and that criminals needed to be held accountable. His cri de cœur preceded what would become a general backlash against disorder in Gotham that led to the election of Rudy Giuliani as mayor and more proactive policing. Kamala claim: “I have not banned fracking as vice president of the United States, and in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking.” Fact check: Harris passed the bill because it was packed with left-wing giveaways. Those new leases were not the point of the bill, and only begrudgingly included to assuage Sen. Joe Manchin. Later, Manchin would accuse President Biden and Harris of going back on their word, saying new regulations were undermining the lease promises. “This is bulls–t,” he told Politico. “So they’re gonna basically starve us out of energy that we have a tremendous, abundant supply of because of their aspirational thoughts?” Kamala claim: “Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not happening.” Fact check: As the Daily Signal points out, Minnesota had a 2015 law that required doctors to report whether abortions resulted in the live birth of a baby. In 2021, it happened at least five times, but no measures were taken to keep them alive. In 2023, Gov. Tim Walz stripped out that reporting requirement as part of an abortion law that has no limitations on how late in a pregnancy it may happen. Kamala claim: “Let’s remember Charlottesville, where there was a mob of people carrying tiki torches, spewing antisemitic hate, and what did the president then at the time say? There were fine people on each side.” Fact check: Harris, along with Biden, always leaves out what Trump said next: “I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists.” Snopes has labeled “false” the idea that Trump praised neo-Nazis. And a bonus fact check of a fact check … ABC moderator David Muir claim: “President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country,” the ABC anchor interjected when Trump said “crime is through the roof.” Fact check: Despite Muir’s efforts to show up Trump, the former president’s response — that the FBI figures are not to be trusted — was absolutely correct. The Marshall Project, which focuses on law enforcement reporting, found that 6,000 law enforcement agencies were missing from the FBI’s 2023 analysis. “This means a quarter of the U.S. population wasn’t represented in the federal crime data last year,” it said. Moreover, whatever small reductions have happened in cities such as Chicago is barely a dent in how much crime skyrocketed in past three years."

In 2021, it happened at least five times, but no measures were taken to keep them alive. In 2023, Gov.

The Marshall Project, which focuses on law enforcement reporting, found that 6,000 law enforcement agencies were missing from the FBI’s 2023 analysis. “This means a quarter of the U.S. population wasn’t represented in the federal crime data last year,” it said.

They did the same to Kamala Harris … never. The vice president was allowed to skate through the debate without substantive follow-up questions or pushback on some of her obviously false claims. So since ABC didn’t do its job, here are some of the fact checks they should have made: Kamala claim: “As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.” Fact check: Our troops in Middle East are absolutely in a combat zone, under attack from Iran, which the Biden-Harris administration has allowed to grow more aggressive in its use of proxies. In January this year, three US soldiers in Jordan were killed by a drone attack from an Iran-aligned group, and dozens of others have been wounded in similar strikes. Kamala claim: “What you’re going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again.” Fact check: The Heritage Foundation, an independent think tank, produced Project 2025, not the Trump campaign. Trump has repeatedly said he wasn’t involved in its writing, does not believe in its policies and won’t implement it. Kamala claim: “Let’s remember, this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for the execution of five young black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five. Took out a full-page ad calling for their execution.” Fact check: Trump’s 1989 advertisement did not call for the execution of the Central Park Five. He talked about a woman raped in the park, but did not mention the names of suspects or who they were. Titled “Bring Back the Death Penalty.

On Wednesday, Tapper said Harris was less than forthcoming about her policies, beginning the debate “by punting the first question on the economy.” “It went on from there,” Tapper said after playing a clip of her response. “Despite the economy being the number one issue facing the country, the sitting vice president generally reverted to talking points about a few of her policy proposals. Even Harris allies today are saying that she needs to talk more about what she will do for Americans if elected.” The host then noted another major question she avoided answering, saying “she also dodged” on the border. When asked how she might have managed the crisis better than President Biden, Harris began, “So I‘m the only person on this stage who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings.” “M’kay, that wasn‘t the question,” Tapper said of her remark. “When asked how she would break through the Israel-Hamas war stalemate Harris said this…” he continued, sharing the clip. “We need a ceasefire deal and we need the hostages out, and so we will continue to work around the clock on that,” Harri said. “OK. But again, how?” Tapper asked. Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.  Tapper, a vehement critic of former President Trump, cautioned he wasn’t “equating” the two candidates. “While by no means are we equating the two performances last night, it is also true that at times both Trump and Harris fell short of giving straightforward answers to questions about how exactly they would run the country,” he said. ABC has been blasted for how it ran the presidential debate, with many arguing the moderators were outright hostile to Trump while going easy on Harris.  Tapper co-moderated the CNN Presidential Debate in June between Trump and Biden.  Biden’s poor performance that night directly led to him being pushed out of the nomination by party leaders in July."

A ‘handful’ of vets indeed and all of one stripe,” smirked Kirby in a note he accidentally cc’d a reporter on, referring to criticism from four veterans slamming the flack and his bosses. This is the attitude taken by a White House that utterly botched our withdrawal from a key geostrategic hotspot.  By a cadre of political careerists who let Afghanistan fall to a bloodthirsty terrorist enemy and saw 13 service members killed in a terrorist attack on Kabul airport.  No use in responding. Pathetic.  And it’s only appropriate that Kirby would blow himself up like this via a mistaken “Reply all” — the story of administration incompetence in a nutshell.  Kirby’s boss, Joe Biden, has displayed an identical callousness.  Checking his watch during the ceremony for the soldiers his failed policies got killed.  Keeping the families of those honored dead at a distance. Insanely blaming his predecessor Donald Trump for the carnage he himself caused.  Kirby’s plainly rattled by the House Foreign Services Committee’s release of a damning, 350-page report on the catastrophe, the result of a multi-year probe, that places blame squarely on the shoulders of the president he serves.  But the correct response would be chastened humility — not cold, partisan indifference to the human costs of Biden’s failure. Yes, partisan: Kirby’s line plainly implies that the vets would be worth responding to, if they had different politics.  That’s the moral core of Biden-Harris: Politics above all.  It’s killing Americans at home and abroad, and a Harris victory in November will ensure only ugly continuity. "

The researchers also determined that 36% of freaky folks in the US prefer having sex at night, and that an impressive 39% actually last the longest after dark.  The finding echo a recent global poll via luxe lingerie label Pour Moi, which found that 10:09 p.m. Saturday evenings is the most popular time to getting it popping.  “It’s really interesting to see how intimacy varies from person to person around the globe,” said the naughty know-it-alls. “But also to know that it is the weekend evenings that seem to be the most popular time for people to feel at their most relaxed and ready to enjoy time with their partner.”"

The FanDuel TV host appeared to jokingly clarify that she wasn’t the “Michelle” people were buzzing about online amid Shannon Sharpe’s viral Instagram Live video on Wednesday, which included audio of him engaging in sex with an unnamed woman.  Later that day, Sharpe addressed the matter on his “Night Cap” podcast with Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson, who said he was glad “it was a Michelle” involved the situation “and not a Michael.” It was not me. 😀 “It was not me,” Beadle wrote on X, adding a smiley-face emoji. Former ESPN personality Jemele Hill replied, “M’AAM.”  NFL Network reporter Jane Slater added, “Marked safe.”  In a separate post, Beadle said, “Just wanted to be transparent.”  Beadle, who’s known for her sarcasm, was clearly joking.  At one point in the Instagram Live — which did not show anyone in the camera, only audio was heard — a male voice seemed to say, “That’s my Michelle,” according to Larry Brown Sports.  Sharpe explained that it was important for him to take accountability for accidentally posting the private, intimate moment on social media.  The Pro Football Hall of Famer said he contacted his agents and his employer, ESPN, to let them know  he was going to address it publicly.   “I said, ‘I just got to tell them the truth,'” Sharpe said. “My phone wasn’t hacked. It wasn’t a prank.  “It was me being a healthy, active male. Ya’ll thought I was bulljiving. Hey, Unc get it in. Real talk.”  Sharpe explained that someone on his team acted quickly and posted the ESPN star was hacked.  However, Sharpe said he had the post taken down.  “I threw my phone on the bed, engaged in an activity,” Sharpe said. “I did not know IG live. I’ve never turned IG live on so I don’t know how it works and all of sudden my other phone started going off.” Sharpe admitted that he’s embarrassed and disappointed in himself.  “Someone that is extremely, extremely private and to have one of your most intimate details – the audio – heard for the entire world to hear, I’m embarrassed for a number of reasons,” he said. “There are a lot of people that count on Shannon to be professional at all times and I always try to be professional at all times, even when I’m behind closed doors. … I’m very disappointed in myself, not for the act. I think there are millions and billions of people of consenting age that engage in activities, but for the audio to be heard I’m disappointed in myself. I let a lot of people down.” Sharpe said his marketing partner, Jamie Fritz, alerted him of the situation and another person eventually ended the live video. "
