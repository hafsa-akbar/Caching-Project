  On the Tuesday, Sept. 10 episode of Unlocked, Savannah, 27, sat down with her best friends in a roundtable-style discussion. Reminiscing on memories together, the reality star’s friend Holly Waldrup brought up a time when she and Savannah had to flee from airport security.
  “It was the funniest thing because I thought she had drugs on her because she was like, ‘We can't go through the security gate,’ and I was like, ‘Okay queen. I don’t know what's going on but I support you. Let's get out of here,’” Holly recalled. 
  “I had a glock,” Savannah admitted. “Not just a gun, a glock.”
  Holly said that she didn’t even ask questions before helping Savannah get out of the security line — which the two had already reached the end of.
  “We went through and they were like, ‘Ma'am we're gonna need to search your bag,’” Savannah revealed. “And Holly moved the gate and we jumped over and just ran.”
  “I had no idea what she had but I was supportive,” Holly said.
  The Chrisley Knows Best alum also clarified that she only ran out of line due to fear, but she obtained her gun legally.
  “I believe in our second amendment rights so I got it very legally,” she explained. “In Texas, you don't have to have a carry permit so nothing was wrong with it, but it wouldn't have been seen too kindly upon.”
  “She said, ‘There's a gun,’ I was like, ‘Put that gun away!'"" Holly added.

  Elsewhere in the podcast, Savannah and her friends talked about her parents Todd and Julie Chrisley's guilty verdict for bank fraud and tax evasion in June 2022. Savannah and her friend Tyler Bishop shared a sweet memory of Julie gifting all the kids with Build-a-Bears installed with her voice saying prayers.
  “What originally happened was she did it for Chloe because she said Chloe's prayers with her every night,” Savannah said. “And she didn't realize — because that was something that she and Chloe always did — then, Grayson had tears in his eyes and was like, ‘I want one too.’ And Build-a-Bear closed in like 30 minutes, and she raced to Build-a-Bear and made him two, made me one, made Chase one. And we all still have it.”
  Although she gets good use out of it, Savannah said 11-year-old Chloe (who is Todd and Julie’s biological granddaughter but has since been adopted) doesn’t use hers as much.
  “Someone played it the other day and Chloe freaked out and was like ‘Don't play it, don’t play it,’ because she hasn't listened to it at all,” she said.
  “Watching y’all for the first time play them to yourselves and listening to it was so heartbreaking,” Tyler added.

(Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for for J/P HRO Gala)",Image 13,https://people.com/lucky-recipient-of-usd10m-from-mackenzie-scott-was-shocked-by-donation-8710983,"The 54-year-old philanthropist previously donated $5 million to the same nonprofit, Access to Capital for Entrepreneurs (ACE), in 2020 Abigail Adams is a Human Interest Writer and Reporter for PEOPLE. She has been working in journalism for seven years.  MacKenzie Scott has donated $10 million to an Atlanta-based nonprofit — and the lucky recipient was surprised by the generous gift.
  Scott, 54, made the “transformative” donation to Access to Capital for Entrepreneurs (ACE) in late August, according to a statement shared by the nonprofit, which describes itself on its website as a community lender that “specializes in small-business loans coupled with business advisory services.”
  Grace Fricks, founder and CEO of ACE, said in a statement that she was presented with the generous donation during a special phone call with one of Scott’s representatives.
  Speaking with The Atlanta Business Chronicle, Fricks said the phone call from Scott’s foundation came “completely out of the blue.”
  In a statement, Frick said she hopes the funds will “propel ACE to the next level” nearly 25 years after it was launched.
  “This is a testament to the social impact of the work ACE does, and does well,” added Fricks, who is retiring at the end of the year, according to the Chronicle.

  ACE helps start-ups and businesses of various sizes “by making loans with generous repayment terms and affordable interest rates,” according to the organization’s website.
  The $10 million donated to ACE was “immediately” made available to help ACE execute its five-year strategic plan — which includes lending $300 million to 1,500 small businesses in Georgia and providing more than 100,000 hours of business advisory services.
  Many of the small businesses assisted by ACE are run by women and people of color, according to the nonprofit.
  “We’re proud of the accomplishments of each of our clients — the more than 2,600 small business owners across Georgia who’ve received ACE’s affordable loans — and grateful for this recognition of the ACE team’s hard work,” Frick said in her statement.
  ACE did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.
  This is the second time Scott has donated to ACE. In 2020, Scott donated $5 million to the organization.
  ACE did not apply for the grant it received from Scott, who began awarding grants in 2019 following her divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the Chronicle.
  In March, Scott announced she had given away $640 million to 361 nonprofits from a pool of more than 6,000 applicants.
  In a post on her Yield Giving website, Scott said each of the selected community-led nonprofits received grants “for their outstanding work advancing the voices and opportunities of individuals and families of meager or modest means, and groups who have met with discrimination and other systemic obstacles.”
  Scott also said she was grateful to “everyone on the evaluation and implementation teams for their roles in creating this pathway to support for people working to improve access to foundational resources in their communities,” describing them as “vital agents of change.”

 John Lamparski/Getty Images  But Bishop, who writes that she’s generally a private person, also opens up about her personal life — including a failed first marriage to a compulsive gambler and the abortion she had when she was in her thirties.“It was such a relief just knowing that that option was there,” Bishop says. “Of course, it never had occurred to me that I would accidentally get pregnant. That never even crossed my mind. But the fact that that was available and legal, it was just a relief.”
  Bishop says that she wasn’t originally planning on including her abortion story in the memoir, though not for “any feeling of shame and wrongdoing.”“That's something private that I just was not going to put in until the Supreme Court got rid of Roe v. Wade,” Bishop says. “And more and more women — actresses, but other celebrity-type women — were coming out of my generation, saying, ‘I had an abortion. I had an abortion.’”

  “I just wanted to include it so that young women of today get a sense of where we were then,” Bishop says.Though she doesn’t have any biological children of her own, Bishop is the stepmother to Norma Sheryl Leonard, the daughter of Bishop’s late husband, former ESPN and CNN host Lee Leonard, who Bishop was married to from 1981 until Leonard’s death in 2018.
  “There was just so much love and respect between the two of us,” Bishop says, of their marriage. “He didn't try to lord it over me. Which is tricky because he was 15 years my senior, from a completely different generation, really.”
  Today, Bishop, who resides in New Jersey with her hound dog Dolly, is keeping another idea from childhood close: the drive to keep learning.“You can learn things every single day. Even little tiny things,” Bishop says. ""Because when you're learning, you're growing.

  After Swift, 34, thanked him during her acceptance speech for the video of the year award at 2024 MTV Video Music Awards, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end liked a video of the sweet moment on MTV's Instagram.
  In the clip, the pop superstar — who won a total of seven Moon Person trophies, including artist of the year at the awards show — praised Kelce for his support while she and Post Malone accepted the award, which they won for their ""Fortnight"" video.
  Swift said during the filming of the music video, Kelce was ""cheering"" from across the studio after every take.
  The superstar singer referred to Kelce as her ""boyfriend"" on stage during the award show in New York City on Sept. 11, which fans pointed out is the first time she's publicly spoken his name and referred to him as her boyfriend.
  During her speech, Swift praised her collaborator Malone and continued, ""The thing is that this video, it seems very sad when you watch it, but it actually was like the most fun video to make.""
  Swift continued, ""And something that I'll always remember is when I would finish a take and I'd say ‘cut’ and we'd be done with that take, I would always just hear like someone cheering from across the studio where we were shooting it, and that one person was my boyfriend, Travis.""

  Perry, 39, received the Video Vanguard Award on Wednesday, Sept. 11 , and in her acceptance speech, quipped that the LGBTQ+ community had taught her “that you can be both kind and c---.”
  In a moment that quickly went viral on social media, Swift, 34, seemed to agree. When Perry said the line, Swift was caught on video shared by Bustle turning to her friend and collaborator Jack Antonoff, who was seated beside her, and smiling. Antonoff, 40, then pointed to the “Anti-Hero” singer as she nodded.
  Swift was seen dancing and singing along to Perry's hits like “E.T.,” “Teenage Dream” and “California Gurls” as the Vanguard winner performed a medley of her biggest songs. The support from the crowd came months after Perry caught an Eras Tour show in Sydney, Australia, in March.
 John Shearer/Getty  The “Firework” singer shared a photo of herself backstage with Swift during the Eras tour, along with video of herself singing along to “Bad Blood,” which is thought to be about their previously rocky friendship.
  Check out all of PEOPLE's full MTV VMAs coverage here.
  Perry opened up in 2020 about why she and Swift decided to put aside their differences, telling Howard Stern the two were now “super friendly.”
  “Gossip in life can take the elevator but the truth takes the stairs. It just takes time,” Perry said  at the time, adding that their feud was exaggerated by the media.
  ""What I’m so grateful for is we did get to make up publicly and got to be an example of redemption for young girls,” she continued. ""I always wanted the best for her and now we can talk about the best we want for each other.”
 Noam Galai/Getty  Swift headed into the VMAs as the most-nominated artist of the night, with 12 nominations, and went home with wins in the video of the year, best collaboration, song of the summer, artist of the year, best pop, best direction and best editing categories.
  “There is a very clear reason why Post Malone is everyone in music’s favorite person,"" she said onstage while accepting the best collaboration win. ""You are so ridiculously talented, you are so versatile and you are the most down to earth person. Honestly so unfailingly polite, it has taken me forever to get him to stop calling me ma'am.""
  In response, Malone joked, “Yes, ma’am,” and said that Swift “is absolutely one of the most kind and talented people I’ve ever had the honor of knowing.”
  The 2024 MTV VMAs aired on Sept. 11 at 8 p.m. ET/ PT live from the UBS Arena in New York.

  Perry, 39, received the Video Vanguard Award on Wednesday, Sept. 11 , and in her acceptance speech, quipped that the LGBTQ+ community had taught her “that you can be both kind and c---.”
  In a moment that quickly went viral on social media, Swift, 34, seemed to agree. When Perry said the line, Swift was caught on video shared by Bustle turning to her friend and collaborator Jack Antonoff, who was seated beside her, and smiling. Antonoff, 40, then pointed to the “Anti-Hero” singer as she nodded.
  Swift was seen dancing and singing along to Perry's hits like “E.T.,” “Teenage Dream” and “California Gurls” as the Vanguard winner performed a medley of her biggest songs. The support from the crowd came months after Perry caught an Eras Tour show in Sydney, Australia, in March.
 John Shearer/Getty  The “Firework” singer shared a photo of herself backstage with Swift during the Eras tour, along with video of herself singing along to “Bad Blood,” which is thought to be about their previously rocky friendship.

  Perry opened up in 2020 about why she and Swift decided to put aside their differences, telling Howard Stern the two were now “super friendly.”
  “Gossip in life can take the elevator but the truth takes the stairs. It just takes time,” Perry said  at the time, adding that their feud was exaggerated by the media.

  The suit, which was filed in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles on Wednesday, Sept. 11 and reviewed by PEOPLE, names Variety and executive editors Tatiana Siegel and Brent Lang. Siegel and Lang appear on the byline for the article, which was initially published on July 26, 2024 and remains live on the Variety website.
  In the suit, Coppola, 85, claims that Variety knew the allegations leveraged against him were ""false"" and they were made to ""harm Coppola's reputation and cause him severe emotional distress."" He further says ""harm has been caused"" and he is seeking no less than $15 million in damages and a jury trial.
  On Wednesday night, a rep for Coppola issued the following statement on behalf of the director to PEOPLE.
  “Nothing in my 60+ years career can equal the painstakingly difficult, yet artistically triumphant journey of bringing Megalopolis to the screen. It was a collaboration of hundreds of artists, from extras to box office stars, to whom I consistently displayed the utmost respect and my deepest gratitude,"" the statement read.
  ""To see our collective efforts tainted by false, reckless and irresponsible reporting is devastating. No publication, especially a legacy industry outlet, should be enabled to use surreptitious video and unnamed sources in pursuit of their own financial gain,"" it continued. ""While I have no intention of litigating this in the media, I will vigorously defend my reputation and have trust in the courts to hold them accountable.""
  Reps for Variety and its parent company PMC did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.
 AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images  The Variety story published in July, which is at the center of Coppola's complaint, cited anonymous sources that claimed the director tried to kiss female extras in a nightclub scene that were ""topless"" or ""scantily clad."" The source was also allegedly reported as claiming at one point after multiple takes, that Coppola grabbed a microphone and said out loud, ""Sorry, if I come up to you and kiss you. Just know it’s solely for my pleasure.""
  The lawsuit also complains about the Variety article's inclusion of video footage reportedly from the scene in question, where Coppola seemingly kisses and dances with female extras while filming in a night club. Siegel and Lang wrote that the video corroborated claims that Coppola was trying to kiss extras that initially surfaced in an article by The Guardian on May 14.
  Background actress Rayna Menz, who appears in the footage, refuted the claims against Coppola in an Instagram message. Menz told Variety's sister publication Deadline that the director “was nothing but professional, a gentleman, he was like this cute Italian grandfather, running around the set.""
  In the court filings, Coppola’s attorneys asserted that before filing the lawsuit, he “provided evidence to Variety that the above allegations were false and Coppola requested that the allegations be retracted. Variety refused and doubled down. It repeated the same allegations and thereby emphasized its malice toward Coppola. In order to clear his name and obtain a public determination of the falsity of Variety’s allegations, Coppola has brought this case.""

https://people.com/,people_in_article,8,1,"Former film producer Harvey Weinstein arrives at at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York on May 1, 2024, for a preliminary hearing after his rape conviction was overturned. ",2,https://people.com/harvey-weinstein-indicted-three-new-charges-8710529,"The former Hollywood mogul faces a retrial on sexual assault and rape charges after an appeals court overturned his 2020 conviction in April  STEVEN HIRSCH/POOL/AFP via Getty  Harvey Weinstein has been indicted by a grand jury on new charges in New York, prosecutors said Thursday, Sept. 12, in Manhattan Supreme Court.
  Weinstein did not appear in court because he is still recovering in the hospital from heart surgery earlier this week.
  His attorneys attended the hearing, where prosecutors announced that a grand jury indicted Weinstein on the additional charges, The Hollywood Reporter was first to report.
  Weinstein, 72, will be arraigned on the additional charges, which are allegations from three alleged victims, at a later date, prosecutors said, ABC News and NBC News report.
  According to the Associated Press, the new allegations against Weinstein encompass three alleged sexual assaults in New York City.
  The additional charges are under seal, according to NBC News.
  In a statement to PEOPLE following the handing down of the indictments, Weinstein's representative, Juda Engelmayer said, in part, ""Harvey is resting in a hospital following heart surgery and is connected to monitors and various IV tubes, as well as bags to relieve the fluids from his body.""
  Engelmayer's statement added, ""The district attorney announced that they have indictments ready, but they have not yet served them. We have no idea what's in them, who they are about, or when any instances have occurred, but the district attorney said that they expect us to be ready to try those in November.""
  NBC News was first to report that a grand jury had been convened to hear from alleged victims who had come forward with new accusations against the disgraced former Hollywood studio head.
  Prosecutors said they will file a motion to consolidate all the indictments related to his case, THR reports.
  On Monday, Sept. 9, Weinstein, 72, underwent emergency heart surgery at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, Juda Engelmayer and Curtis Rothfeld said in a statement sent to PEOPLE.
  The night before, Weinstein was transferred from New York City’s Rikers Island where he has been jailed since his 2020 rape conviction was overturned in April, to Bellevue, his representatives said.
  ""We can confirm that Mr. Weinstein had a procedure and surgery on his heart today however cannot comment any further than that,"" Weinstein’s representatives said.
  He underwent pericardiocentesis surgery to “alleviate the massive amount of fluid on his lung and heart,” Rothfeld told NBC News. 
  Weinstein was kept in the ICU after his surgery, NBC News reports.

  In February 2020, Weinstein was found guilty in New York City of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape during a the landmark #MeToo case, the New York Times reported at the time. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison.
  On April 25, 2024, the New York Court of Appeals overturned that conviction in 4-to-3 decision. 
  The state’s highest court overturned the conviction after finding that trial judge James Burke erroneously allowed three women whose allegations were not a part of the criminal case against Weinstein to testify about his “prior bad acts.”
  On July 19, Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Curtis Farber set a tentative date for a retrial on Weinstein’s rape and sexual assault charges for Nov. 12.
  At an earlier hearing on July 9, prosecutors said Weinstein could potentially face new charges during the retrial.
  During the July 9 hearing, assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg said the state was still investigating additional claims of sexual assault and wasn't ready to send an indictment to the grand jury at this time.
  ""We spoke to several individuals who claimed Weinstein raped them in Manhattan,"" Blumberg said during the hearing, noting that the claims would fall within the statute of limitations.
  “They have a defendant and are looking for crimes,"" Aidala said at the hearing in regard to the alleged investigation. ""That's not how it’s supposed to be.”
  Weinstein currently remains imprisoned for a 2022 conviction of rape in California, where he was sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2023.
  Weinstein’s attorney, Arthur Aidala, and the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s requests for comment.

  PEOPLE confirmed Timberlake, 43, recently reached a plea deal in his DWI case — and now a source tells PEOPLE that he’s ready to put the legal drama behind him.
  “He’s a family man, and this is his focus. He accepted a plea deal because he wants to move on,” the source says. “The court case has been a distraction. He doesn’t want his family to be affected by it.”
  The “Selfish” singer — who is married to actress Jessica Biel, 42, with whom he shares sons Silas, 9, and Phineas, 4 — was arrested in Sag Harbor, N.Y., on June 18 and charged with driving while intoxicated.
 Jerritt Clark/Getty Images  He’s due in court for a hearing in New York on Friday, Sept. 13, and TMZ and the Associated Press reported that he has agreed to plead guilty to a less serious offense. His attorney Edward Burke Jr. has maintained that the star was “not intoxicated” when he was arrested. Still, Timberlake had his license suspended for a year in the state of New York at a hearing in August, something Burke said was “standard.”
  “It’s not like he’s getting off completely — his license is still suspended,” the source adds. “Jess has not been happy about it. She’s encouraged him to accept the plea deal.”
  The 10-time Grammy winner is currently on his Forget Tomorrow World Tour, which the source says is “his priority as well.” He is next scheduled to play on Sept. 28 in Newark, N.J. and will be on the road through June 2025. The tour is on track to land in the top 10 of the year-end tours list per Billboard.  
 JB Lacroix/WireImage  At a Chicago concert in June shortly after his arrest, Timberlake told fans he'd had a ""tough week,"" but that he appreciated their support.
  ""I know sometimes I'm hard to love but you keep on loving me and I love you right back,"" he said to cheers.

 Jerritt Clark/Getty Images  He’s due in court for a hearing in New York on Friday, Sept. 13, and TMZ and the Associated Press reported that he has agreed to plead guilty to a less serious offense. His attorney Edward Burke Jr. has maintained that the star was “not intoxicated” when he was arrested. Still, Timberlake had his license suspended for a year in the state of New York at a hearing in August, something Burke said was “standard.”
  “It’s not like he’s getting off completely — his license is still suspended,” the source adds. “Jess has not been happy about it. She’s encouraged him to accept the plea deal.”
  The 10-time Grammy winner is currently on his Forget Tomorrow World Tour, which the source says is “his priority as well.” He is next scheduled to play on Sept. 28 in Newark, N.J. and will be on the road through June 2025. The tour is on track to land in the top 10 of the year-end tours list per Billboard.  
 JB Lacroix/WireImage  At a Chicago concert in June shortly after his arrest, Timberlake told fans he'd had a ""tough week,"" but that he appreciated their support.
  ""I know sometimes I'm hard to love but you keep on loving me and I love you right back,"" he said to cheers.
  A source told PEOPLE at the time that Timberlake and Biel had “moved on from the arrest,” and were focused on work, with him on tour and her shooting the upcoming Prime Video series The Better Sister.

https://people.com/,people_in_article,10,1,"whirlwind week for Gerry Turner! A group date featuring Jesse Palmer and Kaitlyn Bristowe as well as one-on-one time with two women help confirm his feelings are growing stronger every day, which only makes handing out roses more difficult. T",3,https://people.com/golden-bachelorette-joan-vassos-reveals-why-getting-engaged-wasnt-a-need-exclusive-8710502,"The private school administrator tells PEOPLE that the ending of her season ""was exactly what it was supposed to be""  Golden Bachelorette Joan Vassos didn't need a ring at the end of her season, as long as she left with someone with whom she could see a future.
  “I said all along I didn't need to leave engaged,” Vassos, 61, tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue. “My goal was to leave in a committed relationship. I wanted to have somebody I saw a future with and that we wanted to see how it works in the real world outside of the Bachelor bubble. I didn't want to go through all of this and be at the same place I was when I came to the mansion.”
  The private school administrator — who departed early from Gerry Turner’s season of The Golden Bachelor to be with her daughter after she gave birth — also went into her journey knowing she wouldn’t relocate from her home in Maryland for a new relationship.
  “I would never want to leave my family,” Vassos says. “My kids and my grandkids all live really close to me and not being close to them all the time would not work for me. They're the most important people in my life. I felt that anybody that I would be a good match for, they would have the same family values as I have and would not want to leave their family.”
 John Fleenor/ABC  Vassos realized that she and a potential partner from the show would “have to figure out a different way to make it work” if they didn’t live in the same area.
  “My thought was that, depending on your working status, you could go and spend two weeks at their house and two weeks at your house, or have another location where you would all gather and maybe each other's families would come,” Vassos explains. “You figure it out for a while until you figure out a permanent arrangement, and that could be, feasibly, years.”

  One of Vassos’s suitors, Pablo, hails from Maryland, which she did not expect. “Going into this journey, I assumed that I was not going to have anybody from Maryland or not many people that were geographically really desirable,” she says. “But in the immediate present, I'm not leaving my kids. I don't expect anybody to leave their families. You figure it out. You put the burden on yourself, not in your families.”
 Brian Bowen Smith/Disney  Though Vassos recognized distance might be a factor in a relationship with someone she met on The Golden Bachelorette, she thought going on the show would be more successful in helping her find a partner than dating apps have been.
  “Up until that point, I really was not having a fun time dating,” Vassos admits. “I tried a dating app. I was always hoping a friend would set me up with somebody, and none of those things really seemed to work. I wanted to date, but it seemed like such an effort. I didn't really know how to do it.”

  After leaving 73-year-old Turner’s season, Vassos says she “didn't dive really back into the whole dating thing” as she continued to focus on supporting her family.
  “I posted a video in the beginning of the year and I said my New Year's resolutions, and one of them was to get back out there and start dating,” she recalls. “And then I got a call soon after that saying that they were considering me as a potential Golden Bachelorette and was I interested? So then I definitely didn't date.”
 Disney/Michael Le Brecht  While Vassos can’t say how her season ends, she teases that “the final result was exactly what it was supposed to be.”
  “The journey was wonderful for me, and I ended up being exactly where I think I should be,” she says. “I learned so much about myself. The journey was very revealing and it was joyful, it was exhausting. I can't imagine my life now without having gone through this. I am such a happier person at the end of this journey than I was before I went on it.”
