            An emotional Jordan Chiles opened up Wednesday about how the controversy surrounding her bronze medal in the women’s artistic floor exercise at the 2024 Paris Games affected her, saying the process took away “the person I am.”
     
            US gymnast Chiles was stripped of her first individual Olympic medal after the Romanian gymnastics team challenged the decision to revise her final score in the floor exercise to the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS). CAS eventually upheld the challenge, meaning the US star’s bronze went to Romania’s Ana Bǎrbosu.
     
            On Wednesday, Chiles said that the whole ordeal affected her deeply.
     
            “The biggest thing that was taken from me was the recognition of who I was.Not just my sport, but the person I am,” she told Forbes’ Power Women’s Summit, appearing emotional at times. She was given a round of applause from the watching audience as she collected her thoughts.

            “To me, everything that has gone on, it’s not about the medal. It’s about my skin color. It’s about the fact there were things that have led up to this position of being an athlete. And I felt like everything has been stripped. I felt like when I was back in 2018 where I did lose the love of the sport, I lost it again. … I feel like I was really left in the dark.”
     
            CNN has reached out to the International Olympic Committee, the International Gymnastics Federation and CAS for comment on Chiles’ comments.
     
            Chiles said she had a coach who was emotionally and verbally abusive to her in 2018. She explained she “didn’t have the ability to use my voice or be heard,” adding that the situation at the Olympics brought back similar emotions.
     
            Chiles has previously talked about her abusive coach but has never named her. Chiles spoke of the “huge toll on [her] mental health” the coach’s comments had as she considered quitting gymnastics.
     
            “She called me fat. She said I looked like a donut. To the littlest things that people asking me, ‘Oh, you’re eating this today.’ And it’s like, ‘Well, I’m not eating because you just triggered my brain.’ And it was really, really hard on me,” Chiles told Taraji P. Henson and Tracie Jade on the “Peace of Mind with Taraji” show in 2021.
     
            “Because I was just like, ‘This is ridiculous. Like, what have I put myself through?’ But I was also enjoying it at the same time. So it was, like, half of my brain was telling me one thing, and half of my brain was telling me another.”
     
            Chiles was awarded bronze in the women’s floor exercise at the 2024 Games in August after her coaches challenged her initial score, which had placed her fifth. The win was historic – marking the first time all three positions on the Olympic podium were held by Black women. In a remarkable display of sportsmanship, Chiles suggested she and silver medalist Simone Biles playfully bow to Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade, who won gold. The move was captured in an iconic photo that instantly made sporting history.
     
            The Romanian Gymnastics Federation filed an official challenge with CAS to review the circumstances surrounding the decision to revise Chiles’ score, suggesting that the challenge from the US team came four seconds after the one-minute deadline coaches are permitted.
     
            CAS decided to uphold the challenge and it was later announced that the bronze would be awarded to Bǎrbosu of Romania.
     
            Both the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) and USA Gymnastics (USAG) have said they will appeal the decision, while also claiming that CAS initially sent “crucial communications” to the wrong email addresses, and as a result, the parties were not able to properly prepare for the hearing.
     
            “No-one was listening to the fact that there are things that we have in place … They wanted it all to be about the Olympics and this and that,” Chiles said Wednesday. “It’s a picture. But I make history and I will always continue to make history. It’s something I rightfully did.
     
            “I followed the rules. My coach followed the rules. We did everything that was totally, completely right. So having been left in the dark is something that I feel like they took that all away and were trying to put the name ‘gymnastics’ in front of it.”
     
            USAG has also voiced concerns about Dr. Hamid G. Gharavi, who has represented Romania in previous arbitration cases, chairing the CAS panel. CAS says that none of the parties involved objected to Gharavi’s appointment to the panel, but USAG claims that it was never informed of his ties to Romania.

            When archaeologist Ludovic Slimak unearthed five teeth in a rock shelter in France’s Rhône Valley in 2015, it was immediately obvious that they belonged to a Neanderthal, the first intact remains of the ancient species to be discovered in that country since 1979.
     
            However, the once-in-a-lifetime find, nicknamed Thorin after a character in “The Hobbit,” remained a well-kept secret for almost a decade while Slimak and his colleagues untangled the significance of the find — a fraught undertaking that pitted experts in ancient DNA against archaeologists.
     
            “We faced a major issue,” said Slimak, a researcher at France’s National Centre for Scientific Research and Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse. “The genetics was sure the Neanderthal we called Thorin was 105,000 years old. But we knew by (the specimen’s) archaeological context that it was somewhere between 40,000 to 50,000 years old.”
     
            “What the DNA was suggesting was not in accordance with what we saw,” he added.
     
            It took the team almost 10 years to piece together the story of the puzzling Neanderthal, adding a new chapter in the long-standing mystery of why these humans disappeared around 40,000 years ago.
     
            The research, published Wednesday in the journal Cell Genomics, found that Thorin belonged to a lineage or group of Neanderthals that had been isolated from other groups for some 50,000 years. This genetic isolation was the reason Thorin’s DNA seemed to come from an earlier time period than it actually did.
     
            Until now, geneticists thought that at the time of extinction there was one Neanderthal population that was genetically homogeneous, but the new study reveals at least two populations were present in Western Europe at that time — and they lived surprisingly close to each other.

            “The Thorin population spent 50,000 years without exchanging genes with other Neanderthal populations,” Slimak said in a news release.
     
            “We thus have 50 millennia during which two Neanderthal populations, living about ten days’ walk from each other, coexisted while completely ignoring each other.”
     
            Slimak said that the discovery suggested that Neanderthal communities were small and insular — factors that could be key to understanding their extinction because isolation is generally considered to be an evolutionary disadvantage.
     
            Less genetic variation could make it harder to adapt to changing climate or disease, while less social interaction between groups makes it harder to share knowledge and technology.
     
            “They were happy in their valley and did not need to move, while Homo sapiens all the time they want to explore, to see what is there after this river, after this mountain. (We have) this need, this need to move, and this need to build a social network,” Slimak said.
     
            This pattern of small populations, isolated culturally and genetically from one another, was likely a major factor behind Neanderthal extinction, which occurred around the same time Homo sapiens arrived in Europe, he said.
     
            DNA from Homo sapiens fossils from that time show that these early arrivals interbred with Neanderthals — traces of those encounters remain in present-day human populations. However, no corresponding genetic evidence of that interbreeding has been found in Neanderthal fossils from that time, including Thorin’s remains, the study noted.
     
            Whatever behavior led to this lack of genetic intermingling on one side, along with small and isolated Neanderthal populations such as the one Slimak and his colleagues identified, likely contributed to the disappearance of the Neanderthals, said Chris Stringer, research lead in human evolution at London’s Natural History Museum who wasn’t involved in the study.

            “Whatever the reasons for this imbalance (social, biological?) it contributed to the demise of the last Neanderthals, since their already small populations were losing reproductive age individuals to the other species, without any replenishment in return,” Stringer said via email.
     
            “Coupled with economic competition from the newcomers over resources, this could have been a recipe for demographic collapse.”
     
            It’s not clear whether Thorin’s full skeleton is interred within Grotte Mandrin, as the rock shelter in the Rhône Valley near Malataverne, France, is known. The remains were found near the surface in soft, unstable ground, and the excavation continues slowly, Slimak said, with archaeologists tweezing out “one grain at a time.” It’s also unclear whether the specimen, which is male, was deliberately buried or not.
     
            Archaeologists have excavated more of Thorin’s remains: 31 teeth, part of the jaw and five finger bones, so far. The shape of his teeth is typical of a Neanderthal, but he had two extra lower molars — a trait sometimes suggestive of an inbred population, the study noted.
     
            The initial genetic analysis suggested that Thorin was much older because his genome was distinct from other later Neanderthals, resembling the genomes of ancient humans who lived more than 100,000 years ago. 
 
            To understand Thorin’s origins and confirm the age of his remains, the team analyzed chemical isotopes in his bones and teeth to infer what type of climate he lived in based on the water he would have drunk and other factors. A Neanderthal in Europe 105,000 years ago would have a enjoyed a much warmer climate than one living 45,000 years ago during the Ice Age.
     
            “We worked for seven years to find out who was wrong — archaeologists or genomicists,” Slimak said in the news release.
     
            Slimak has been involved in the excavation of Grotte Mandrin for more than three decades and made a number of exciting finds at the rock shelter. It’s the only known site to have been home to alternating groups of both Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, plus the earliest evidence of bow and arrow use outside Africa.
 
            “Grotte Mandrin keeps delivering surprises,” Stringer said.

            Archaeologists have excavated more of Thorin’s remains: 31 teeth, part of the jaw and five finger bones, so far. The shape of his teeth is typical of a Neanderthal, but he had two extra lower molars — a trait sometimes suggestive of an inbred population, the study noted.
     
            The initial genetic analysis suggested that Thorin was much older because his genome was distinct from other later Neanderthals, resembling the genomes of ancient humans who lived more than 100,000 years ago. 
 
            To understand Thorin’s origins and confirm the age of his remains, the team analyzed chemical isotopes in his bones and teeth to infer what type of climate he lived in based on the water he would have drunk and other factors. A Neanderthal in Europe 105,000 years ago would have a enjoyed a much warmer climate than one living 45,000 years ago during the Ice Age.
     
            “We worked for seven years to find out who was wrong — archaeologists or genomicists,” Slimak said in the news release.
     
            Slimak has been involved in the excavation of Grotte Mandrin for more than three decades and made a number of exciting finds at the rock shelter. It’s the only known site to have been home to alternating groups of both Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, plus the earliest evidence of bow and arrow use outside Africa.
 
            “Grotte Mandrin keeps delivering surprises,” Stringer said.

Editor’s note: Relive the SpaceX Polaris Dawn historic commercial spacewalk as it happened.
 
            A four-person crew of civilians on board SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn mission unlocked the hatch of their capsule and made history as the first group of non-government astronauts to conduct a spacewalk.
     
            SpaceX hosted a live webcast of the event — also known as an extravehicular activity (EVA) — which kicked off at 6:12 a.m. ET.

            The entire SpaceX Crew Dragon vehicle propelling and protecting the crew was depressurized and exposed to the vacuum of space — a dangerous and historic milestone in the Polaris Dawn crew’s five-day journey through Earth’s orbit. The mission has already set records, traveling farther into space than any human since NASA’s Apollo program concluded more than 50 years ago.
     
            The crewmates — which includes Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman, Polaris Dawn’s financer; his close friend and former US Air Force pilot Scott “Kidd” Poteet; and SpaceX engineers Anna Menon and Sarah Gillis — had prepared for this spacewalk since taking flight at 5:23 a.m. ET Tuesday.
     
            The team slowly underwent what’s called a “pre-breathe” process, a step intended to purge their blood of nitrogen to prevent the gas from bubbling — a potentially lethal condition — as they experienced the vacuum of space.
     
            Isaacman exited the capsule first just before 7 a.m. ET.
     
            He walked up a mobility aid — essentially a ladder that SpaceX has dubbed “skywalker” — to venture into the endless void and took in the views.
     
            “Back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here — looks like a perfect world,” Isaacman said.
     
            Gillis and Isaacman were the only two crewmembers to actually exit the spacecraft, and they did so for a combined total of roughly 20 minutes.
     
            Gillis exited the capsule for about 10 minutes after Isaacman returned to his seat. She spent her time outside wiggling around in her spacesuit — as expected — to help test out its mobility.
     
            Developing spacesuits that fit and function more like normal clothes than the highly restrictive and puffy white suits that have been used during spacewalks of the past is a key goal for SpaceX.
     
            But the cabin’s windows still afforded incredible views for the entire crew, providing mind-blowing glimpses of Earth whisking by below. The Polaris Dawn crew can see a sunrise and sunset about every 106 minutes.
     
            “It is honestly one of my favorite views,” Mennon said. “The sun peaks over the horizon and the whole world just lights up — or the whole world goes to sleep. And you just get to witness this hour after hour, and it’s so beautiful. Our Earth is so beautiful.”
     
            NASA Administrator Bill Nelson offered his congratulations after the spacewalk in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
     
            “Congratulations @PolarisProgram and @SpaceX on the first commercial spacewalk in history!” Nelson wrote. “Today’s success represents a giant leap forward for the commercial space industry and @NASA’s long-term goal to build a vibrant U.S. space economy.”
     
            Though the crew previously reached a peak altitude of more than 1,400 kilometers (870 miles), the spacewalk occurred while their vehicle traveled between 190 and 700 kilometers above Earth (118 to 435 miles).
     
            All told, the Crew Dragon capsule spent about two hours exposed to space with the hatch open.
     
            “There’s a lot of time built in for venting (or depressurizing the spacecraft) and repressurizing,” Isaacman told CNN about the two-hour spacewalk window. “And probably the biggest fear that (we’ve tried to) protect for is a failure to repressurize the vehicle — because then all you have is your oxygen reserves to get back home in about two hours if needed.
     
            “So I don’t expect we’ll have too much sight-seeing time,” Isaacman added.
     
            While Isaacman and Gillis were outside the capsule, however, they focused on demonstrating how their brand-new EVA suits work in space.
     
            EVA suits essentially function as spacecraft unto themselves — just shaped and formatted to fit the human body. Unlike the iconic puffy white spacesuits that government astronauts use while exiting the International Space Station for a spacewalk, the SpaceX EVA suits do not include a Primary Life Support System, or PLSS, according to Garrett Reisman, a former NASA astronaut who serves as a SpaceX consultant.
     
            A PLSS is essentially a backpack that allows ISS astronauts to float more freely through space to carry out complex tasks, such as repairing and replacing hardware outside the space station. Instead, the Polaris Dawn crew will receive their life support from long hoses attached to their spacecraft.
     
            Still, SpaceX’s EVA suits are an impressive feat of engineering. The company designed and developed the spacesuits in just two and a half years — specifically for this mission.
     
            The goal was to develop spacesuits that could one day be produced on a large scale, rather than expensive and bespoke objects currently used by space agencies.

            When discussing the vision for the EVA suits in an interview with CNN, Isaacman referenced the bigger picture goal: to one day have entire settlements of people living in space.
     
            Isaacman said he discussed that vision with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, and they agreed: “We need space suits. And, you know, they shouldn’t cost hundreds of millions of dollars. We need tens of thousands of them someday.”
     
            Now that the spacewalk has concluded, the Polaris Dawn crew will spend another couple days in orbit checking off remaining mission goals.
     
            That includes working through the rest of a list of nearly 40 experiments. Some of that research is centered around dealing with the daunting biological challenges that humans face while floating in a spacecraft.
     
            When asked by CNN, many of the crew members said they’re most excited for experiments focused on gaining a better understanding of space adaptation syndrome, a deeply uncomfortable condition known to affect about about 1 in 2 people that travel to orbit.
     
            Gillis added that one experiment the Polaris Dawn crew will tackle involves putting on special contact lenses that have pressure transducers (or highly accurate measuring instruments) on them. The lenses will gauge how the crew members’ eyeballs are responding to pressure changes as they adapt to life swimming around in microgravity, according to Gillis.
     
            “We call it kind of endearingly ‘the cyborg experiment,’” she said.
     
            And a demonstration of SpaceX’s Starlink internet-beaming satellites being used for in-space communication is expected at some point during the mission.
     
            The Crew Dragon spacecraft could make its return to Earth this weekend, potentially in the early hours of Sunday morning, as the Polaris Dawn crew has said they expect their trip to last about five or six days.

Here’s what’s really going on,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/08/travel/why-people-are-making-videos-of-their-airport-trays-now/index.html,"
    Editor’s Note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.
 
            No sooner have airports introduced new scanning machines so you don’t need to unpack your carry-on bags, than a trend emerges where you photograph all your loose items in your airport security tray.
     
            The “airport tray aesthetic” has taken off on TikTok, Instagram and Pinterest as people share artfully arranged shots of their sunglasses, shoes, toiletries and reading material inside the regulation polypropylene dishes.
     
            Don’t expect crumpled plastic bags stuffed with toothpaste and Pepto-Bismol. This is aspirational travel, where your 35mm film camera nestles between your vintage loafers and your first-edition copy of “On the Road.”
     
            It’s the latest in a line of trends where people curate their possessions for a public showcase, from bookshelves to bedside tables to even the insides of our refrigerators. (Yes, “fridgescaping,” which involves storing flowers and picture frames alongside your butter and eggs, is now a thing).
     
            However, the trend is ruffling more than a few feathers, due to the airport security line being one of the top places in the world where it’s imperative to avoid dilly-dallying.
     
            Think-pieces have naturally been spilling forth.
     
            The New York Post slammed the “time-consuming trend” as an influencer-led blight upon the nation’s TSA lines.
     
            The UK’s Metro newspaper said that “‘the anxiety-inducing trend’ risks you becoming the most hated person in the airport.”
     
            Comments on Shop Pursue’s TikTok video showing young women preparing for a “girls’ trip” by organizing their Adidas Gazelles and Louis Vuitton bags on a bench range from “ik the people behind yall were annoyed waiting” to “you would get tased in JFK for this.”
     A post shared by Stackers Official (@mystackers) 
            However, like many things happening online, all is not quite what it seems.
     
            In a TikTok video with 82,000 likes so far, New York-based influencer Chelsea as of Late gives a step-by-step tutorial on following the trend and not being a nuisance.
     
            The key, she says, is to do it after going through security: Find a quiet spot and “if you have time set up a few different trays, cause why not?”
     
            That, however, is still an area intended for travelers who need it for necessary repacking of items or for a more urgent rest stop.
     
            Let’s also not forget that with all those shoes passing through security trays, you may as well be laying your items straight out on the floor. In 2018, a European study found that airport trays are the least hygienic part of the airport, carrying more germs than toilets.
     
            So while hand sanitizer doesn’t typically feature in these airport tray photos and videos, it should probably play a key part in the aftercare.
     
            The trend has unsurprisingly been a huge hit with marketing teams around the world, with brands including clothing and homeware retailers Anthropologie and book publishers Faber all posting their stylized boxes.

            She then curates her travel-themed selections to her heart’s content.

            No sooner have airports introduced new scanning machines so you don’t need to unpack your carry-on bags, than a trend emerges where you photograph all your loose items in your airport security tray.
     
            The “airport tray aesthetic” has taken off on TikTok, Instagram and Pinterest as people share artfully arranged shots of their sunglasses, shoes, toiletries and reading material inside the regulation polypropylene dishes.
     
            Don’t expect crumpled plastic bags stuffed with toothpaste and Pepto-Bismol. This is aspirational travel, where your 35mm film camera nestles between your vintage loafers and your first-edition copy of “On the Road.”
     
            It’s the latest in a line of trends where people curate their possessions for a public showcase, from bookshelves to bedside tables to even the insides of our refrigerators. (Yes, “fridgescaping,” which involves storing flowers and picture frames alongside your butter and eggs, is now a thing).
     
            However, the trend is ruffling more than a few feathers, due to the airport security line being one of the top places in the world where it’s imperative to avoid dilly-dallying.
     
            Think-pieces have naturally been spilling forth.
     
            The New York Post slammed the “time-consuming trend” as an influencer-led blight upon the nation’s TSA lines.
     
            The UK’s Metro newspaper said that “‘the anxiety-inducing trend’ risks you becoming the most hated person in the airport.”
     
            Comments on Shop Pursue’s TikTok video showing young women preparing for a “girls’ trip” by organizing their Adidas Gazelles and Louis Vuitton bags on a bench range from “ik the people behind yall were annoyed waiting” to “you would get tased in JFK for this.”

            However, like many things happening online, all is not quite what it seems.
     
            In a TikTok video with 82,000 likes so far, New York-based influencer Chelsea as of Late gives a step-by-step tutorial on following the trend and not being a nuisance.
     
            The key, she says, is to do it after going through security: Find a quiet spot and “if you have time set up a few different trays, cause why not?”
     
            That, however, is still an area intended for travelers who need it for necessary repacking of items or for a more urgent rest stop.
     
            Let’s also not forget that with all those shoes passing through security trays, you may as well be laying your items straight out on the floor. In 2018, a European study found that airport trays are the least hygienic part of the airport, carrying more germs than toilets.

Ex-President Donald Trump is equivocating over the possibility of a second debate with Kamala Harris after his dud display in their first showdown prompted his team and conservative media allies to mount a frantic cleanup operation.
     
            It’s far too early to say whether the tangle in Philadelphia substantially changed the race as Harris beseeches remaining movable voters in swing states to ditch the chaos of the Trump era. But in the aftermath of Tuesday’s debate, both campaigns are surveying the impact of a critical clash before more than 60 million viewers eight weeks from Election Day.

The long and complex political legacy of 9/11
 
            Trump, who took multiple victory laps following President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance in late June, found himself facing the kind of inquest endured by his erstwhile rival. While the ex-president’s campaign will not suffer the same fate as Biden’s shuttered reelection effort, the debate was the latest sign that Trump is still failing to focus on the new challenges posed by Harris and make his own best case.
     
            The vice president was basking in a fresh jolt of euphoria among Democrats who perceive an oft-doubted political figure growing in stature with every test she passes. Harris’ campaign is also leveraging the endorsement of Taylor Swift, which could open a new seam of interest among the pop megastar’s loyal fanbase.
     
            But history suggests that a first debate between two candidates is not historically a reliable predictor of who wins the election. Despite Harris’ strong performance, it’s not yet clear how much progress she made in building the path to 270 electoral votes.
     
            Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell, who consistently warns Democrats not to take her swing state for granted, told CNN’s Kasie Hunt on Thursday that Trump’s base is energized and that the race could not be closer.
     
            “I was ecstatic, like every other Democrat, as I watched the debate. I thought she got under his skin. He reminded much of America about who he was and what he was. She showed people she could be the commander in chief,” Dingell said. But, she added: “At 6:50 yesterday morning, one of my township supervisors called me and wanted to know what I thought. And I said, ‘Well, what did you think?’ And that discussion brought me right back down to Earth.”
     
            “I think Michigan is a dead heat,” she said.

27 lines to explain the Trump-Harris presidential debate
 
            Meanwhile, Harris’ allies are reinforcing the tone of mockery and attempts to goad Trump that emerged at the Democratic National Convention and that the vice president carried into the debate. Philippe Reines, a former Hillary Clinton aide who played Trump in Harris’ debate prep, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday that the ex-president has slowed mentally since 2016 and compared him to a “malfunctioning appliance.”
     
            “He was all over the place but to some extent structured,” Reines said, referring to Trump when he took on former Secretary of State Clinton. “Now, he’s all over the board.” He added: “I think he’s losing (his) train of thought and he’s just blurting out the next thing in his mind.”
     
            Hours after the debate, the political bile briefly eased as Harris and Trump, along with Biden and Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, gathered at Ground Zero in New York to honor the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2001. The general election rivals only met for the first time at the debate, but they shared their second handshake in 12 hours in a gesture of national unity orchestrated by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg.
     
            In a more light-hearted scene Wednesday, a grinning Biden took the extraordinary step of donning a Trump 2024 baseball cap. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said the president gave a hat to a Trump supporter during a visit to a fire station in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, near where the fourth hijacked jet crashed short of its target on 9/11 after a passenger revolt. The Trump supporter had said that “in the same spirit POTUS should put on his Trump cap. He briefly wore it,” Bates said.

            But it was only a temporary respite to the bitter fallout from the debate.
     
            The former president did what he always does when presented with unfavorable political facts — deny them. He declared on Fox News on Wednesday that he had “one of my better debates,” despite sweeping negative reviews of his showing. Trump also launched an attack on ABC News, claiming the debate was “rigged” and faulting moderators who fact checked him for setting up a “three-to-one” tag team against him.
     
            But one of his newest associates, former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., may have inadvertently highlighted Trump’s deficiencies in the debate even as he tried to praise the ex-president whom he recently endorsed.
     
            Kennedy said on Fox News that while Trump won the debate on “substance,” Harris “clearly won the debate in terms of her delivery, her polish, her organization and her preparation.”
     
            “I think on substance, President Trump wins in terms of his governance,” Kennedy said. “But he didn’t tell that story.”
     
            Still, Trump’s complaints were more eagerly picked up among his longtime boosters in conservative media, underscoring the way that the Republican Party always falls in line behind its leader. However, Trump’s narrative that he was thwarted by two TV anchors sat uneasily with his claim on stage that he’s such an intimidating figure that US enemies were simply scared of him.
     
            Trump was correct in arguing that he was fact-checked more thoroughly than Harris on Tuesday night by moderators who missed several chances to correct the vice president or to hold her to account for dodging questions. But Harris said nothing that compared to the gusher of untruths from the former president, which included a claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were slaying and eating residents’ dogs and cats. (That racist claim was debunked Wednesday by Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, who said there was “no credible evidence.”)
     
            Adopting a more sinister tone in his interview with Fox, the former president accused ABC of putting on a “rigged deal” and warned officials “ought to take away their license.” His comments were ominous considering he’s vowed to wage a presidency of “retribution” if he is elected to a second term in November that would include the use of presidential power to punish his enemies.
     
            The former president also Wednesday publicly toyed with the idea of a second debate, after the Harris campaign challenged him to another round. But the former president, smarting from his treatment at the hands of the vice president on Tuesday, doesn’t seem to be in a hurry to renew the performance.
     
            One the one hand, he may have little incentive to show up again given that he was widely seen to have suffered a drubbing on Tuesday. But if the polls show him trailing in the run-up to the election, there might be a rationale for a do-over. The Harris campaign has a similar conundrum. There’s a case for the vice president folding her tent given that she might not be able to repeat Tuesday’s performance.
     
            Trump, however, is trying to change perceptions of the debate after the fact.
     
            “In the World of Boxing or UFC, when a Fighter gets beaten or knocked out, they get up and scream, ‘I DEMAND A REMATCH, I DEMAND A REMATCH!’ Well, it’s no different with a Debate. She was beaten badly last nigh. Every Poll has us WINNING,” he wrote on Truth Social, “so why would I do a Rematch?” As is often the case, the ex-president’s reading of polls was exaggerated. A flash CNN poll performed by SSRS after the debate found that watchers thought Harris put in a stronger performance by 63% to 37%.
     
            History suggests that it takes at least a week for the full impact of a debate to filter down into the electorate. And the fundamentals of the neck-and-neck race with Harris still seem to favor the former president, whose campaign ads are targeting the vice president over the current administration’s record on the economy, including high prices, inflation and immigration, with an intensity and level of focus that Trump as a candidate has come nowhere near matching.
     
            Trump’s running mate has also been more effective at delivering a sharp political message than his boss. He weaved a dismissal of the Swift endorsement for Harris into a wider attack on the vice president on Fox News. “When grocery prices go by up by 20%, it hurts most Americans. It doesn’t hurt Taylor Swift,” Vance said. “When housing prices become unaffordable, it doesn’t affect Taylor Swift or any other billionaire. It does affect middle-class Americans all over our country.”
     
            The challenging political backdrop explains why things are still tense at Harris headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. A senior campaign aide told CNN’s MJ Lee that the assumption was that the election remained a 50-50 proposition. “It’ll be incredibly close. We cannot take our foot off the gas, even when the moment feels really good,” the aide said.
     
            Harris also faces choices beyond whether she’ll agree to another debate. While her performance was stylistically strong on Tuesday, she still dodged key questions — for instance, the very first one on whether she believes Americans are better off now or when Trump was in office. The Trump campaign is sure to keep up its drumbeat of complaints that she’s avoiding deeper media scrutiny. And there are many signs that voters want more substance from the Democratic nominee.
     
            Several voters who are undecided or leaning toward Harris or Trump, but open to changing their candidate, told CNN’s John King that Harris did well in the debate but several also cautioned she was not sufficiently specific in explaining her policies.
     
            “Kamala Harris says she wants to lift up the middle class, but how?” said Linda Rooney, who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs and voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the primary. She also voiced concern about Harris shifting her positions on fracking and other issues.
     
            Such doubts are evident in recent national polls too. But they also reflect the fresh complications Trump has caused for himself with his underwhelming debate performance: He may have squandered his best and last chance to expose Harris over those vulnerabilities in front of tens of millions of voters.

The Trump campaign is sure to keep up its drumbeat of complaints that she’s avoiding deeper media scrutiny. And there are many signs that voters want more substance from the Democratic nominee.
     
            Several voters who are undecided or leaning toward Harris or Trump, but open to changing their candidate, told CNN’s John King that Harris did well in the debate but several also cautioned she was not sufficiently specific in explaining her policies.
     
            “Kamala Harris says she wants to lift up the middle class, but how?” said Linda Rooney, who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs and voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the primary. She also voiced concern about Harris shifting her positions on fracking and other issues.
     
            Such doubts are evident in recent national polls too. But they also reflect the fresh complications Trump has caused for himself with his underwhelming debate performance: He may have squandered his best and last chance to expose Harris over those vulnerabilities in front of tens of millions of voters.

https://edition.cnn.com/,cnn_in_article,6,1,OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the Microsoft Build conference in Seattle on May 21.,Mr ChatGPT and other AI power players are going to the White House to discuss AI’s massive thirst for energy,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/12/tech/ai-chatgpt-white-house-power-energy/index.html,"
            The face of artificial intelligence in America is set to meet with top US officials at the White House on Thursday, CNN has learned, in a first-of-its-kind meeting to solve a riddle that could severely strain US infrastructure: how to power the AI boom.
     
            Sam Altman,  the CEO behind ChatGPT maker Open AI, Google senior executive Ruth Porat and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei are expected to be among the tech executives in attendance, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.
     
            The meeting, which hasn’t been previously reported, is the first time senior White House officials will sit down with tech company leadership to discuss how to quench AI’s insatiable thirst for energy. The source said the White House expects to detail how the public and private sector can work together to maintain US leadership in AI in a sustainable way.
     
            The effort shows how business leaders and government officials are being forced to confront emerging challenges posed by the AI boom, which has captivated investors on Wall Street.
     
            Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other top officials from the Biden-Harris administration are also set to attend, along with representatives from Microsoft, according to a White House official.
     
            Neither President Joe Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to attend.
     
            The rapid development of energy-intensive AI has sparked worries about the technology straining America’s aging power grid at a time when the Biden administration is attempting to speed the transition away from coal and other fossil fuels.
     
            Although AI has the potential to solve thorny problems like the climate crisis and cancer, it poses equally complex challenges, including how to meet the significant demand for electricity required by advanced AI systems.
     
            A single request on ChatGPT consumes about 10 times as much electricity as a typical Google search, according to the International Energy Agency. By 2026, the AI industry is projected to consume at least 10 times as much as in 2023, the IEA said.
     
            AI is expected to spark a 160% surge in power demand from data centers by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs. AI’s appetite for energy is so great that it will force long-stalled US power demand to increase significantly the rest of this decade, the bank has said.
     
            An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to CNN that Altman plans to attend the meeting and will focus on how building out America’s AI infrastructure — power generation, data centers and semiconductor manufacturing — will create jobs.
     
            In a recent op-ed in the Washington Post, Altman described the question of who will control the future of AI as “the urgent question of our time.”
     
            “The United States currently has a lead in AI development,” Altman wrote, “but continued leadership is far from guaranteed. Authoritarian governments the world over are willing to spend enormous amounts of money to catch up and ultimately overtake us.”
     
            Altman has a lot at stake in this issue. Not only is he the face of the AI industry, but he has invested in Exowatt, a startup that is betting solar power can help shrink AI’s carbon footprint. Exowatt just launched a new system that can generate and store clean energy to AI data centers.
     
            “President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to deepening US leadership in AI by ensuring data centers are built in the United States while ensuring the technology is developed responsibly,” White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson told CNN in a statement.
     
            Other US officials expected to attend Thursday’s AI power meeting include White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and top climate officials Ali Zaidi and John Podesta.
     
            The meeting follows a July 2023 effort by the Biden administration to get leading AI companies to pledge to put new AI systems through outside testing before public release and clearly label AI-generated content.
     
            It’s a big day for Sam Altman: He will appear on an 8 pm ET special about AI on ABC hosted by Oprah Winfrey. Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates will also appear on the show.

            California’s Line Fire is burning so intensely that it created its own weather.
     
            Dramatic pyrocumulus, or “fire clouds,” exploded over the fire Monday at the exact time a high-resolution weather satellite hundreds of miles above Earth’s surface was looking down at the planet.
     
            Pyrocumulus clouds form over intense heat sources, like raging wildfires or volcano eruptions. The air above such intense heat is quickly and chaotically forced to rise, which cools and condenses the air’s moisture, forming clouds.
     
            But pyrocumulus clouds also ingest large amounts of smoke and ash from the fires that form them, making these clouds a lot darker than a typical white, puffy cloud.
     
            That’s exactly what the Landsat-8 satellite, a joint data-gathering venture between NASA and the United States Geological Survey, saw on Monday.
     
            Massive pyrocumulus clouds bubbled up above the raging Line Fire, sending plenty of smoke and ash thousands of feet into the air. These clouds looked more like dirty cauliflower or used cotton balls on the satellite imagery compared to the puffy, white cumulus clouds to the east of the fire.
     
            The pyrocumulus clouds were also surrounded by smoke that appears light brown or tan-colored on the satellite image.
     
            Later in the day, the Line Fire’s pyrocumulus clouds eventually morphed into pyrocumulonimbus which produced lightning and rain, according to NASA.
     
            While rain from a storm like this may help firefighting efforts, the gusty thunderstorm winds and additional lightning strikes on dry areas could ignite new fires.

Attorney General Merrick Garland slammed efforts to turn the Justice Department into a “political weapon” during a fiery speech Thursday to department staff and US attorneys from across the country amid attacks from former President Donald Trump and his allies.
     
            Garland decried the “escalation of attacks” against its career staff in years through “conspiracy theories, dangerous falsehoods, efforts to bully and intimidate career public servants by repeatedly and publicly singling them out, and threats of actual violence.”
     
            “It is dangerous to target and intimidate individual employees of this Department simply for doing their jobs,” he said from the DOJ headquarters in Washington. “And it is outrageous that you have to face these unfounded attacks because you are doing what is right and upholding the rule of law.”

The ‘sleeper case’ trying to stop Trump and the RNC from intimidating voters and poll workers
 
            The attorney general’s comments come as Trump has claimed that the Justice Department has been weaponized against him amid his criminal prosecutions and suggested that he would politicize the department should he return to the Oval Office.
     
            Neither Trump nor his allies were mentioned by name.
     
            “There is not one rule for friends and another for foes, one rule for the powerful and another for the powerless, one rule for the rich and another for the poor, one rule for Democrats and another for Republicans, or different rules depending on one’s race or ethnicity,” the attorney general said.
     
            “Our norms are a promise that we will not allow this nation to become a country where law enforcement is treated as an apparatus of politics,” Garland added to applause.
     
            Trump and his associates have publicly discussed plans to dismantle the department and its law enforcement components like the FBI, or to prosecute his political enemies.
     
            Trump has repeatedly attacked the Justice Department under Biden, claiming without evidence that the president has used the department to criminally pursue him and his allies for political purposes. During Tuesday’s presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump pushed those claims again, falsely claiming that Biden and his administration were behind the state-level election subversion case brought against him by local prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia, and the criminal fraud case brought against him in New York.
     
            “They weaponized the Justice Department. Every one of those cases was involved with the DOJ, from Atlanta and Fani Willis to the attorney general of New York and the DA in New York. Every one of those cases,” Trump claimed. “And then they say, ‘Oh, he’s a criminal.’ They’re the ones that made them go after me.”
     
            During his speech, Garland noted he was tapped to lead the Justice Department in 2021 and had a goal to “fiercely protect the independence of this department from political interference in our criminal investigations.”
     
            The department took steps to achieve that goal, Garland said, including reinstituting policies that regulate contacts that department personnel have with the White House and Congress, clarifying guidelines for sensitive FBI investigations and updating protections that reporters have from law enforcement investigations.
     
            Garland also thanked the prosecutors and Justice Department staff for refusing to “bend to politics” and “break under pressure.”
     
            “You deserve better,” he said.

            Having trouble navigating the complicated, often frustrating, world of airline loyalty programs?
     
            This might help: Point.me, a points and travel reward search platform, has ranked 62 global airline rewards programs using nine criteria, with ease of earning miles, redemption rates, availability on partner airlines and ease of booking as the most important factors.
     
            Flying Blue, a loyalty program attached to Air France and KLM, is the world’s No. 1 airline rewards program, according to the rankings. Air Canada’s program, Aeroplan, ranks No. 2, with United Mileage Plus coming in at No. 3 on the global list.
     
            This year’s rankings are the first edition of what’s slated to be an annual list from Point.me, a platform aimed at helping customers get the best value from their points.
     
            “We want to provide that transparency and confidence in earning and redeeming points and help people not feel like this is a Wild West where they don’t understand how to use points. They don’t know what programs are good. We want to bring that clarity,” said  Tiffany Funk, the company’s president and co-founder, on a call previewing the rankings.
     
            On a 100-point scale, Flying Blue bested its closest competitor by more than 15 points, with a score of 93.06. Point.me cited the program’s “ease of earning points through its extensive partnerships and great redemption values” as its core strengths. Air Canada’s Aeroplan earned high marks for “reward seat availability on partner airlines with the most extensive network globally and generous routing.”
     
            United Airlines has received some negative attention in recent years as it has reevaluated the airline experience for its most frequent flyers, Funk acknowledged, “but they’re actually very competitive in many metrics and they are excellent for those less frequent flyers.”
     
            British carriers Virgin Atlantic and British Airways rounded out the top 5 on the global list with a tie. US carriers American (No. 6), Alaska (No. 7) and JetBlue (No. 9) also made the top 10 on the global list.
     
            Delta Air Lines did not appear in the global top 10. The platform also ranked airlines by region, where Delta ranked No. 8 among North American carriers. Funk suggested that Delta has intentionally deprioritized SkyMiles in recent years, putting more of an emphasis on areas such as operations, airport lounges and crew to build loyalty.

Frequent flyer programs: The most profitable part of the airline industry
 
            Air Canada’s program led the North American rankings, with Avianca LifeMiles No. 1 in Latin America, Qatar Airways Privilege Club taking the top spot in the Middle East and Africa region and Cathay Pacific Asia Miles, Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer and ANA Mileage Club tying for the top spot in the Asia-Pacific region.
     
            In an increasingly confusing landscape, many frequent flyers complain that their airline points aren’t worth as much as they used to be. Last week, the US Department of Transportation announced a consumer protection probe into US airlines’ loyalty programs.
     
            “Our goal with this inquiry is to ensure that customer rewards are protected from any practices that would diminish their value, benefit, or availability,” says a DOT letter to the CEOs of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.
     
            Funk said generally such an investigation should help. “I think it does speak to this overall confusion and stress that people have over loyalty programs and not being sure if they’re actually getting a good value.”
     
            One rule of thumb for travelers: “If people aren’t getting at least a penny a point when they’re using their miles, they would most likely be better off using a cash back card,” Funk said, rather than trying to earn points directly through an airline’s loyalty program.
     
            “The best way to give yourself access to all of these programs and the high value opportunities out there is to shift your spending to a credit card that offers flexible or transferable points,” she said.

            Russia has launched a counter-attack in the Kursk border region where Ukrainian forces last month launched a surprise cross-border incursion.
     
            “The Russians have started counteroffensive actions,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a news conference Thursday, his first comments since reports emerged of Russia fighting back in Kursk.
     
            Ukraine has been anticipating a Russian reaction and a counteroffensive is in line with the ‘Ukrainian plan,’ Zelensky said.
     
            Zelensky has previously said that the surprise attack on Russia’s Kursk region was the initial step in a four-part “victory plan.”
     
            The Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement Thursday that Russian forces had “penetrated” into the Kursk region, capturing 10 settlements.
     
            A social media video geolocated by CNN showed a Russian mechanized assault group in the settlement of Snagost on the western edge of territory controlled by Ukraine.
     
            On August 6, Ukrainian forces stormed into the Kursk region in a shock, lightning strike that caught even American officials by surprise. It marked the first foreign attack on Russian soil since World War Two and saw thousands of troops burst through the border into the region armed with heavy weaponry.
     
            It signaled that, despite Russia’s advantage in terms of men and armor, its military has vulnerabilities.
     
            The attack left Russia scrambling to shore up its defenses, with US officials telling CNN that Moscow had to divert thousands of troops from occupied territory inside Ukraine to counter the threat. Russian President Vladimir Putin was forced to bring in conscripts, backpeddling on a promise he made not to use them on the frontline.
     
            Last week, Zelensky said Ukraine had captured around 100 settlements in the Kursk region, and around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory.
     
            One aim of the incursion was to divert Russian forces away from the eastern frontline in Ukraine, where they continue to make incremental gains. Another apparent goal was to boost morale in the Ukrainian army after a torrid few months.
     
            Experts told CNN that Ukraine’s bold gambit to breach Russia’s border – planned in total secrecy – had stunned even Kyiv’s closest allies and shifted the playing field of a more than two-year war.
     
            In a joint public appearance on Sunday, both CIA chief Bill Burns and Head of MI6 Richard Moore endorsed Ukraine’s invasion of Kursk, with Moore saying that it changed the narrative, and Burns that it was a significant tactical achievement.
     
            In a separate development, Russian shelling killed three employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) while they were working in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky said.
     
            The ICRC said its workers were killed when their vehicles were hit as they prepared to distribute wood and coal briquettes to residents in the region.
     
            The organization did not say who was behind the shelling.
     
            ”We are shattered,” ICRC Ukraine Spokesman Pat Griffith told CNN. “Three of my colleagues killed, two injured, during an aid distribution in Donetsk region.”
     
            The three ICRC staffers who were killed in the artillery shelling were Ukrainian nationals, Ukraine’s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said.
     
            ICRC teams are regularly present in the Donetsk region and their vehicles are “clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem,” the organization said.
     
            The ICRC called for the respect of international humanitarian law, “including by taking every precaution possible to ensure that those engaged in humanitarian activities are not targeted or caught in hostilities.”
     
            Zelensky called the shelling on the ICRC team “another Russian war crime.”
