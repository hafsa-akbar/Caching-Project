Ministers under the then home secretary refused to give caseworkers permission to tackle outstanding cases covered by the Illegal Migration Act, departmental sources and the UK’s biggest civil service union have told the Guardian. A leaked email from May indicates that senior staff overseeing asylum caseworkers were waiting for “key decisions to be made in the coming weeks” and diverting staff to other tasks. The number of asylum decisions fell dramatically in the weeks before the July general election, data released last week showed. Between March and June this year, the Home Office made decisions on 15,965 applications, down from 24,348 in the first three months. Only 1,150 asylum interviews took place in June, down from more than 8,000 last October, according to the data. Fran Heathcote, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which represents asylum caseworkers, said: “We’re aware of the slowdown in asylum decisions between March and June but this in no way reflects a lack of effort or performance from our members. “Instead many of our members were diverted on to other workstreams whilst the Illegal Migration Act prevented decisions being made on asylum claims made since March 2023 and the previous government dithered on making the decisions required to unlock these. “Our members tell us that processing of claims has started to ramp up again since replacement arrangements were introduced in the king’s speech.” The Illegal Migration Act was introduced on 7 March 2023 and meant that most asylum claims made by people arriving irregularly after that date could not be processed. The act was supposed to be used in conjunction with plans for mass deportations to Rwanda. Critics claim that because the Rwanda plan was halted by legal challenges, the act led to a growing “perma-backlog” of people trapped in limbo. Asylum caseworkers had already had considerable success in clearing the so-called “legacy backlog” of cases from before 28 June 2022, when the Nationality and Borders Act came into force. Home Office insiders said the department during the spring could have processed many asylum claims that had been made between 7 March and 19 July 2023 using powers under section 30(4) of the Illegal Migration Act to grant temporary leave to remain to those who receive positive decisions. However, ministers did not grant such permission. A leaked Home Office memo sent in May from a senior asylum and human rights operations civil servant said staff were being diverted to other work while awaiting a decision. “As you know we successfully delivered the legacy backlog clearance in December 2023 and now, building on our track record excellence we have completed NABA [Nationality and Borders Act] 1A delivery,” the senior civil servant wrote. “In terms of next steps, there are some key decisions to be made in the coming weeks on a range of issues related to our work and as soon as our plans are clear I will share this with you. In the meantime, we are rebalancing some of our asylum resource – and as you know in particular we are focusing our resource on our fee waiver and human rights routes within AHRO [asylum and human rights operations],” the senior civil servant wrote. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Overall, 118,882 people were waiting for an initial decision on asylum applications in the UK at the end of June, up slightly from the 118,329 in March. Critics have identified the backlog as one of the biggest problems within the UK’s faltering asylum system. Hotels housing claimants awaiting decisions cost the taxpayer £8m a day, according to the Home Office, and were the focus of far-right protests and arson attacks during this summer’s riots. About three-quarters of all claimants are eventually recognised as refugees, but cannot work and must claim benefits while they wait for a decision. Responding to the PCS’s claims, Cleverly said: “The legacy asylum backlog was cleared when I was home secretary. We doubled caseworkers and productivity increased, with four times as many decisions to June 2024 as in the previous year. As a result [the number of] those awaiting an initial decision was cut by over a third and we returned 150 asylum hotels to commercial use.” A source close to the Conservative leadership candidate dismissed the criticisms, saying: “Conservative ministers were asked to wave 100,000 people into our asylum system by way of an amnesty. They didn’t do it, but Labour did.” The number of people who have crossed the Channel in small boats has passed 20,000 for the year so far. The Home Office said 614 people were brought ashore in Dover on Wednesday, bringing the annual total for 2024 to 20,433. The figure is up 3% on this time last year, but down 18% on 2022."
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/29/cnn-harris-walz-interview,‘I’m the best person to do this job’: Harris gives first major interview of campaign,"[{'image_url': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/693cbee91048d839fcaf87a9ae965a7564984d7d/476_19_1214_729/master/1214.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'image_alt': 'US vice-president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris'}]","Kamala Harris sat for her first interview as the Democratic presidential nominee with CNN’s Dana Bash alongside her running mate, Tim Walz, on Thursday, and defended her shifts on certain policy issues over the years and her support for Joe Biden. In the interview, which was taped from Savannah, Georgia, earlier Thursday, the vice-president said her highest priority upon taking office would be to “support and strengthen the middle class” through policies including increasing the child tax credit, curtailing price gouging on everyday goods and increasing access to affordable housing – all policies that she has announced since she started campaigning for the presidency. Harris also shared how the president shared with her his decision not to continue running for re-election, a first public retelling of that moment. She said she was making breakfast with her family, including her nieces, and was just sitting down to do a puzzle when the phone rang, she said. “I asked him, are you sure? And he said yes. And that’s how I learned about it.” As far as whether she asked for his endorsement or he offered it, she said: “He was very clear that he was going to support me.” “My first thought was not about me, to be honest with you, my first thought was about him,” she said, adding that history will remember Biden’s presidency as transformative. Harris defended Biden, saying she had no regrets about supporting his re-election before his decision to leave the race, despite concerns over his age and acuity. She said serving as Biden’s vice-president has been “one of the greatest honors” of her career and that Biden has the “intelligence, commitment, judgement and disposition that the American people deserve in their president”, adding that the former president, Donald Trump, “has none of that”. She also touted the Biden administration’s work to restore the economy after the pandemic, pointing to capped insulin costs, the current inflation rate of under 3% and increases in US manufacturing jobs. “I’ll say that that’s good work,” she said. “There’s more to do, but that’s good work.” Harris explained her changes in positions on issues such as fracking and immigration by saying her “values had not changed”. On fracking, she said she made clear in the 2020 debate that she no longer supports a ban, and that as president she would not ban fracking. She added that she takes the climate crisis seriously but believes: “We can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.” On immigration, Bash pointed to a moment when Harris raised her hand to indicate she believed the border should be decriminalized, asking if she still believes that. Harris said she thinks laws should be followed and enforced on immigration and noted that she is the only candidate in the race who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations. She also said she would appoint a Republican to her cabinet if she wins, though she didn’t have a specific Republican or position in mind. “I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion,” she said. “I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my cabinet who was a Republican.” She quickly cast off a question about Trump’s comments that she “happened to turn Black” in recent years: “Same old, tired playbook,” she said. “Next question, please.” The interview narrowly met a self-imposed timeline Harris set for a sit-down interview, which she promised would happen by the end of August. It comes less than two weeks before the first scheduled debate between Harris and Trump, planned for 10 September on ABC. Harris and Walz conducted the interview while on a bus tour around the Savannah, Georgia area as part of a whirlwind tour of the US since they took over the Democratic ticket. Harris has gotten criticism from across the political spectrum for not doing an on-the-record interview with the media since she started running for president. After the CNN interview was set, Republicans also criticized the joint interview with Walz and that the interview was pre-recorded and not live. Before the interview, Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance posted on Twitter/X: “BREAKING: I have gotten ahold of the full Kamala Harris CNN interview” alongside a clip from the 2007 Miss Teen America pageant where a contestant garbled an answer about Americans not knowing geography, rambling about “like such as South Africa -and the Iraq, everywhere like such as”. Sign up to The Stakes — US Election Edition The Guardian guides you through the chaos of a hugely consequential presidential election after newsletter promotion Walz answered a few questions during the joint interview, though Harris largely led the campaign’s responses. Walz has faced scrutiny over misstatements and exaggerations he has made about his time in the national guard and about the specific fertility treatments his wife used. He didn’t explain in depth why he made these comments, instead saying that he speaks candidly and passionately. In one comment, he claimed he carried weapons of war in war, which he did not (he was not deployed to a war zone). He said that comment came after a school shooting and his grammar wasn’t correct. “I think people know me. They know who I am. They know where my heart is,” he said. “If it’s not this, it’s an attack on my children for showing love for me, or it’s an attack on my dog,” he said, referring to recent Republican attacks on him. “The one thing I’ll never do is I’ll never demean another service member in any way. I never have and I never will.” Bash brought up two key moments from the Democratic convention: Walz’s teenage son, Gus, crying and saying “that’s my dad” as his dad took the stage, and an image of one of Harris’s grand-nieces looking on as Harris gave her acceptance speech. Walz said his son’s reaction was “such a visceral emotional moment” that he was grateful to experience. Harris, who has not spoken much about how her win could break glass ceilings, said she was “deeply touched” by the photo and found it “very humbling” while saying: “I am running because I believe I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender.” It’s unclear if Harris will start doing more media interviews as she continues on the campaign trail. As some commentators on CNN noted before the interview aired Thursday, increasing the frequency of interviews makes it less likely that each one becomes the topic of intense scrutiny and fixation like the CNN event became. Trump reacted to the interview on Truth Social, saying simply: “BORING!!!”"

The proposals, not denied by the prime minister, would potentially prohibit tobacco use outside pubs and restaurants, including on pavements. The restrictions would come on top of existing plans to gradually outlaw smoking year by year. While the latter proposal was devised under Rishi Sunak, the Conservatives argued restrictions on outdoor smoking were about “social control”, with Priti Patel – among those standing to replace Sunak as Tory leader – calling them “beyond stupid”. The plans were met with despair by the pub industry, which claimed restrictions on outdoor smoking could harm a fragile sector still recovering from Covid. However, health experts backed the idea, while polling showed it had majority support among every demographic and voting group apart from Reform UK supporters. The plan, first revealed via documents leaked to the Sun, would restrict outdoor smoking outside pubs and restaurants, as well as clubs, and at universities, children’s play areas and small parks, and potentially shisha bars. It was unclear whether this could also cover vaping. The measures would be included in an already-announced tobacco and vapes bill, which intends to gradually make all smoking illegal by prohibiting the sale of tobacco to people born on or after January 2009. When this was announced in July’s king’s speech, it did not mention changes to outdoor smoking. As public health is devolved, the measures would apply to only England, with the other UK nations deciding if they wanted to follow suit. Asked about the report during a visit to Paris, Starmer did not deny the plans. “My starting point on this is to remind everybody that over 80,000 people lose their lives every year because of smoking,” he said. “That is a preventable death, it’s a huge burden on the NHS and, of course, it is a burden on the taxpayer. So, yes, we are going to take decisions in this space, more details will be revealed, but this is a preventable series of deaths and we’ve got to take action to reduce the burden on the NHS and the taxpayer.” While the precise curbs are likely to change after consultation, it is understood ministers are in favour of many of the suggested ideas. The hospitality industry figures, and pub owners in particular, said they were concerned the measures could prompt renewed uncertainty, even with official statistics showing only about one in 10 British adults still smoke. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, which represents thousands of pubs, restaurants and cafes, said a ban raised the prospect of “serious economic harm” to venues. “You only have to look back to the significant pub closures we saw after the indoor smoking ban to see the potential impact it could have,” she said. Nicholls called on the government to hold a “detailed conversation” with affected parties on the potential impact of such a ban before any legislation was put in place. William Lees-Jones, the head of JW Lees Brewery, which owns and operates 150 pubs, inns and hotels mainly in north-west England and north Wales, said the idea was a “bolt from the blue” that had not been discussed with industry. He said it would be “really bad for business” and could “shut a lot of pubs”. “People who smoke are pretty determined and will walk 10 yards down the road and smoke there, which will annoy other people,” he said. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Clive Watson, the chair of the Inda Pubs group, called it “a bonkers idea”, adding: “Surely, after all the pub industry has been through, we should be allowed a period of stability?” Tim Martin, the chair of JD Wetherspoon, said he did not think a ban would have a “big effect” on business, but added: “The question is whether the government should interfere in individual liberties, where danger is involved.” Dr Layla McCay, the director of policy at the NHS Confederation, said she was “heartened” to see progress being made on abolishing smoking. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It is absolutely the health challenge of our time. It’s the leading cause of preventable illness in the UK, so we are heartened to see that progress is being made and that the intention is moving forward to really address one of Britain’s main drivers of health inequalities.” While a majority of Conservative MPs voted for Sunak’s gradual smoking ban in April, a number opposed the plan. Patel, the former home secretary, argued on Wednesday that the outdoor smoking curbs would harm businesses and potentially endanger public safety if police resources were used to enforce it. Robert Jenrick, also standing to be Tory leader, tweeted of Starmer: “This man does not understand our country.” The Liberal Democrats said the plans must be balanced against any potential impact on hospitality venues. YouGov polling carried out on Thursday showed the public tended to support the plan, with 58% of people saying they backed the idea, against 35% who did not. The figures were virtually identical for Conservative voters. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We do not comment on leaks. Smoking claims 80,000 lives a year, puts huge pressure on our NHS, and costs taxpayers billions. We are determined to protect children and non-smokers from the harms of secondhand smoking. We’re considering a range of measures to finally make Britain smoke-free.” After smoking in enclosed public places and workplaces was barred in 2007, according to the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), in the year after there were 12,000 fewer overall admissions to hospitals in England, including a 12.3% drop in hospital admissions for childhood asthma."

McVey, the MP for Tatton and a former cabinet minister, posted on X the words of Martin Niemöller’s 1946 poem First They Came, about inaction from within Germany against the Nazis. It includes the lines: “Then they came for the Jews. And I did not speak out.” McVey ended her tweet: “Pertinent words re Starmer’s smoking ban.” First they came for the Communists⁰And I did not speak outBecause I was not a communistThen they came for the Jews⁰And I did not speak out⁰Because I was not a JewThen they came for me⁰And there was no one left⁰To speak out for mePertinent words re Starmer’s smoking ban The health secretary, Wes Streeting, responded on X: “No, I do not think the postwar confessional of Martin Niemöller about the silent complicity of the German intelligentsia and clergy in the Nazi rise to power is pertinent to a Smoking Bill that was in your manifesto and ours to tackle one of the biggest killers. Get a grip.” McVey’s tweet was condemned by the the Board of Deputies of British Jews as “repugnant”. “The use of Martin Niemöller’s poem about the horrors of the Nazis to describe a potential smoking ban is an ill-considered and repugnant action,” it said. “We would strongly encourage the MP for Tatton to delete her tweet and apologise for this breathtakingly thoughtless comparison.” Rabbi David Mason posted on X: “Tasteless. Utterly tasteless. How can you not see that?” McVey posted a statement later on Thursday night insisting she would not remove the original tweet. She said: “Nobody is suggesting that banning smoking outside pubs can be equated with what happened to the Jews at the hands of the Nazis. It is ridiculous for anyone to even suggest that was what I was doing. “It is called an analogy – those who restrict freedoms start with easy targets then expand their reach. “I am pretty sure everyone understands the point I was making and knows that no offence was ever intended and that no equivalence was being suggested.” She added: “I will not be bullied into removing a tweet by people who are deliberately twisting the meaning of my words and finding offence when they know none was intended.”"

Tom Baldwin said that after Starmer took office he had spoken with the prime minister in Thatcher’s former No 10 study, unofficially known as the Thatcher Room, where a portrait of her was on display. Speaking at an event organised by Glasgow’s Aye Write book festival, Baldwin said: “We sat there, and I go: ‘It’s a bit unsettling with her staring down as you like that, isn’t it?’” Starmer replied yes and, when asked whether he would “get rid of it”, the prime minister nodded, according to Baldwin. Baldwin added: “And he has.” The portrait of Thatcher, painted by Richard Stone, was commissioned by Gordon Brown and unveiled at a private reception in 2009. Brown invited Thatcher to tea at Downing Street shortly after he succeeded Tony Blair in 2007 and told her he intended to commission the painting. The artwork, which cost £100,000 and was paid for by an anonymous donor, was the first of a former prime minister to be commissioned by No 10. Thatcher chose the jewellery and buttons she was shown wearing in the portrait. The decision to take down the painting, first reported by the Herald, has been criticised by some in the Conservative party. Greg Smith, the MP for Mid Buckinghamshire, told the Telegraph the decision was “utter pettiness from Starmer” and claimed that it showed he had “no respect for our history and previous prime ministers”. Murdo Fraser, a Scottish Tory leadership candidate, said: “It seems like a churlish move, but perhaps Sir Keir Starmer was intimidated by the gaze of a world-renowned leader whose achievements he will never come close to matching.” Last December, Starmer praised Thatcher for bringing “meaningful change” in Britain. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Labour leader said she had “set loose our natural entrepreneurialism” during her time as prime minister. No 10 has been contacted for comment."

The convoy, organised by the US-based NGO Anera, was carrying medical supplies and fuel to an Emirati-run hospital in Rafah on Thursday evening at the time of the attack. Its route had been coordinated in advance with the IDF, under a deconfliction process intended to prevent aid vehicles being bombed. Anera’s Palestine country director, Sandra Rasheed, said: “This is a shocking incident. The convoy, which was coordinated by Anera and approved by Israeli authorities, included an Anera employee who was fortunately unharmed. “Tragically, several individuals, all employed by the transportation company we work with, were killed in the attack. They were in the first vehicle of the convoy.” Unconfirmed reports from Gaza said five people were killed in the airstrike. An IDF statement confirmed the route had been coordinated, but claimed that “during the convoy’s movement, a number of armed assailants seized control of the vehicle in the front of the convoy (a Jeep) and began to lead it”. It added: “After the takeover and further verification that a precise strike on the armed assailants’ vehicle can be carried out, a strike was conducted. “No damage was caused to the other vehicles in the convoy and it reached its destination as planned. The strike on the armed assailants removed the threat of them seizing control over the humanitarian convoy.” The IDF claimed it had contacted Anera after the incident and that the aid organisation had “verified that all of the convoy’s organisation members and humanitarian aid were safe and reached their destination as planned”. Anera confirmed that the convoy did reach the hospital, but said only one person travelling in the convoy was an Anera employee. The rest worked for its partner transport company, which was not named. “We are urgently seeking further details about what happened,” Rasheed said. The airstrike on the convoy came hours after Israeli soldiers opened fire on a World Food Programme (WFP) vehicle clearly marked with UN insignia, travelling in a convoy of two. The WFP said the vehicle was hit by at least 10 bullets as it approached an IDF checkpoint at Wadi Gaza. The vehicle was armoured with reinforced glass and no one inside was injured, but the agency temporarily suspended movement of its staff around Gaza. Cindy McCain, the head of the WFP, called the shooting “totally unacceptable”. “As last night’s events show, the current deconfliction system is failing and this cannot go on any longer,” McCain said. On 1 April, the IDF killed seven aid workers in a drone attack on a convoy run by the World Central Kitchen charity. The IDF admitted to “grave errors” by its officers, firing two of them, and conceded that it had been informed of the planned convoy in advance but said the information had not been passed down to operational units. An IDF investigation also claimed an officer thought he saw a gunman on the roof of a truck being escorted by the charity’s vehicles, while watching grainy surveillance footage. There was no evidence that any gunman was present."

The former UK government chief scientific adviser was made a peer and appointed science minister this year after Keir Starmer’s party swept to victory in the general election. And he made clear on Thursday that, if he had been asked by Rishi Sunak to consider serving in a Tory government: “I wouldn’t have done, no”. “As a civil servant, I’m very happy to serve under any government, and would do so because that’s the role of the civil service,” Lord Vallance added. “But as a minister, obviously, you then have [a] political angle to that as well, and that adds a layer of complexity. You can’t be a minister and not part of a political system, and that’s different.” Last year, Vallance’s private diaries from the Covid pandemic made the headlines, revealing his frustration with the politicians at the heart of government at the time. But he said his main concern was about science not being integrated in the system. “I am not sure I was individually critical of what ministers were doing,” he said. “What I said was I thought the government as a whole didn’t have a mechanism well enough developed to take science and technology into all the places it needs to be, because I can’t think of a single area of policy or operations where science technology or engineering wouldn’t make a difference,” he told the Guardian. His comments came alongside the announcement that the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) has reopened recruitment for a new chief executive of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Vallance said he would set the new head of UKRI – the country’s largest public research funder with a budget of £9bn a year – the challenge of transforming the body. He said that as well as funding curiosity-driven research – something he described as “the goose that lays the golden egg in years to come” – UKRI would also direct money into research that would support the government’s five missions, including kickstarting economic growth and making Britain a clean energy superpower. “If we can get government to want to use research in order to understand how better to deliver [those] missions, I think we’ll end up with better results, faster results – whether that’s a technology answer or whether it’s a social science answer, or whether it’s some other answer,” he said.

While the campaign for a new CEO was initially launched earlier this year, it has reopened after the general election under the new government. Vallance said Leyser’s successor would have to be a leader capable of dealing with a wide portfolio and able to bring people from different disciplines together to tackle problems. “What’s the point of having UKRI if it isn’t about bringing things together and getting some of that cross-fertilization? And that’s both between disciplines, and between private and public sector.”"

As the government prepares to receive a report on profound failings at its Care Quality Commission (CQC) that triggered the chief executive’s removal this summer and a public apology, the Homecare Association warned 37% of providers of domiciliary care services had not been rated for at least four years and 23% had never been rated. Inspectors are supposed to check staff are caring, properly trained and not harming the vulnerable people they look after. Dr Jane Townson, the chief executive of the Homecare Association, whose members look after about 800,000 people in England in their own homes, said: “Insufficient inspections are jeopardising service quality, safety and public confidence. “The state of homecare regulation in England is like a ship taking on water, with a crew using buckets instead of pumps to bail it out. People relying on care services are at risk of being left adrift.” Labour says it wants to increase the amount and quality of care provided to people at home as part of its manifesto goal to move the NHS to more of a “neighbourhood health service, with more care delivered in local communities to spot problems earlier”. The depth of the problems has created an uneven playing field, where some councils are awarding public contracts to providers that have not been assessed or rated. Others are disallowing providers without ratings and causing some to go out of business, the Homecare Association said. It said a lack of inspectors to cover a fivefold growth in the number of small domiciliary care providers over the last decade and ineffective leadership at CQC were among the causes of the crisis. Ian Trenholm stood down as chief executive of CQC in July after serious problems with a new IT system and complaints from Care England, which represents large private care home chains, about “CQC’s overreliance on outdated data, the lack of transparency in their regulatory approach and vast inconsistencies between assessments”. In May, the Cabinet Office and the Department of Health and Social Care commissioned a wide-ranging independent review of CQC’s effectiveness, led by Dr Penny Dash, the chair of the NHS North West London integrated care board and a former partner with McKinsey, which is expected to report back in the coming weeks. An interim report in July found “significant failings in the internal workings of CQC which have led to a substantial loss of credibility within the health and social care sectors, a deterioration in the ability of CQC to identify poor performance and support a drive to improved quality – and a direct impact on the capacity and capability of both the social care and the healthcare sectors to deliver much-needed improvements in care”. Care Rights UK, which represents care users and their families, said its advice line was hearing the same concerns. Its helpline and programmes manager, Emma Williams, said: “CQC’s insistence on continually reducing inspections is in ignorance to an increasingly struggling sector.

A survey of 75 homecare providers found more than three-quarters were dissatisfied with the CQC, with issues including inspectors not answering emails for months and in one case “bullying tactics”. Kate Terroni, the interim chief executive of CQC, said the regulator was working “to rebuild that trust and become the strong, credible and effective regulator of health and care services that the public and providers need and deserve”. “We’ve committed to increasing the number of inspections we are doing so that the public have an up-to-date understanding of quality and providers are able to demonstrate improvement,” she said, adding it was increasing the number of people working in registration and working to improve on current IT systems “so we can improve waiting times and deliver better outcomes for everyone”."

The professional dancer, who won the BBC competition in 2010 with his celebrity partner, Kara Tointon, was booked into Napa county jail on Thursday morning, according to online jail records. It is not clear what led to the arrest of Chigvintsev, who posted a $25,000 (£19,000) bail. Chigvintsev later appeared on the US version of Strictly, Dancing with the Stars, where in 2017 he was partnered with his future wife, the WWE star Nikki Bella. The Russian dancer joined Strictly during series eight in 2010, when he was partnered with the ex-EastEnders actor Tointon, a relationship that blossomed into a real-life romance for several years. The 42-year-old also made it to the semi-final of the show in 2011 with the actor Holly Valance, before he was partnered with the TV veteran Fern Britton in the 2012 series. He was last partnered with the Coronation Street star Natalie Gumede in 2013, with the pair securing the runner-up spot. The couple have a son, who was born in 2020 just hours before Nikki’s twin sister, Brie Garcia (AKA Brie Bella), announced the arrival of her second child. The siblings starred in the E! reality show Total Bellas for five years. Nikki Bella and Chigvintsev previously said they found out they were expecting just two-and-a-half weeks after getting engaged in Paris, and they married in 2022. His arrest comes days after he celebrated the two-year wedding anniversary with his wife. Representatives for Chigvintsev have been contacted for comment."

The bee, Apis florea, is native to Asia and its discovery has raised alarm among local beekeepers and conservationists, who fear the potentially devastating impact on native bee populations. “It is concerning that Apis florea has been found in Malta,” said Dave Goulson, a professor of biology at the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the research. “Apis florea is likely to compete for pollen and nectar with our native pollinators, a group of insects that are already in decline. It is also very likely that these bees will be carrying multiple diseases which European bees may have little resistance to.” Previous reports show the red dwarf species has slowly expanded its territory from Asia to the Middle East and north-east Africa, but until now it had never been reported in Europe. “If it is in Malta, this is the first occurrence of a honeybee in Europe that is not the western hive bee, Apis mellifera,” Francis Ratnieks, a British entomologist and emeritus professor of apiculture at the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the research, said. When the colony, consisting of more than 2,000 adult bees, was discovered encircling a tree branch, DNA testing was done to identify the species. As soon as the species was identified as Apis florea it was removed and destroyed. But the researchers, who wrote in the Journal of Apicultural Research, suspect a group of bees had already left the hive to start a new colony. The proximity of the colony to Birżebbuġa freeport, Malta’s major cargo hub, suggests the bees may have arrived via a commercial vessel. “This is one of the main (and faster) routes through which different subspecies of Apis mellifera, as well as other bee, wasp and other flying insect species can move from their native ranges to more remote locations,” said Juliana Rangel, a professor of apiculture at Texas A&M University, who was not involved in the research. Rangel said this new finding was yet another example of increasing temperatures due to the climate crisis driving the spread of species to previously unoccupied territories. The researchers believe the mild winters in Malta and other southern European countries favour the survival of this invasive species. The red dwarf honeybee is also found in Israel.

It could be “a matter of just a few years” for this species to spread to another location, Rangel said. “Given the large number of islands in the Mediterranean that are relatively near each other, and the fact that the continental land is also so nearby, it is very plausible that more of these incursions will occur in the future, threatening our biodiversity in ways that we may not even yet understand. “The only thing that we can do is to be vigilant, report any sightings of specimens or swarms that appear different or new, remove the specimens as soon as they are positively identified, search the vicinity for other specimens, and continue with monitoring efforts, especially in ports of entry where swarms can be travelling on ships.”"

A Grade II-listed railway viaduct in rural Cheshire has had to be guarded by a wall to stop souvenir-hungry Harries damaging the 183-year-old structure. The Twemlow Viaduct, which carries England’s busy west coast mainline, has become a shrine for Styles fans from across the world as it is reputedly the site of his first kiss. Thousands of people have scrawled their name into its Edwardian arches, leaving messages such as: “You are home,” “We’ll be alright” and even “Harry – I’ve had your baby.” The viaduct, near Styles’s childhood home in the idyllic village of Holmes Chapel, has become a must-visit attraction since it featured in a 2013 film about the rise of One Direction. But it has taken on a whole new level of fame since Styles’s popularity went stratospheric in recent years, prompting villagers to launch official tours in June. Many fans have written their names on the historical structure, while others have taken their hunt for a souvenir one step further. “People are putting murals and messages of support on; however, the paints and solvents are actually damaging the brickwork and people have been taking bricks out,” said Rob Stephens, a senior engineer for Network Rail, which maintains the viaduct. The rail firm has now fenced off part of the 23-arch structure and erected a specially constructed wall with black boards for fans to inscribe their names, with the aim of preventing further damage. Within 24 hours, Harries from as far away as the US and Germany had left messages on the new wall. Sophia Trey and her friend Emmagin Warner, both 19, had made “Harry’s wall” their first sightseeing trip while visiting the UK from their home in Denver, Colorado. “It’s insane,” said Trey, placing a pebble in the colours of the Colorado flag by one of the arches. “It doesn’t feel real but in the best way possible. It’s so amazing to see 15 years of fans. It’s a step into his home.” Warner said: “It’s like a dream. [Harry] wrote on it in the movie. It’s a place to bring everybody together because all of us get to sign the wall. We all love each other in this fandom.” The two friends had made the 4,500-mile trip to the UK for Trey’s 20th birthday and were making a flying visit to Holmes Chapel before travelling to London to see a concert by Niall Horan, Styles’s former bandmate, the next week. Trey said she approved of the new protective fence: “I think it’s great because once it starts to become harmful it’s like, OK, why are we doing that? Keeping it like it is is important.” Caitlin Dixon, 14, had made a shorter trip to the viaduct – she attends Styles’s old school in Holmes Chapel – and was pleased to see village’s heritage being protected: “Harry would definitely approve of it. It’s nearly 200 years old so it’s good to stop it being ruined and fans can still come down and sign it.” About 10,000 Styles fans are expected to have visited Holmes Chapel by the end of this year – nearly double its population and twice the number who made the pop pilgrimage in 2023. Peter Whiers, chair of the Holmes Chapel Partnership, which launched the guided tours in June, said concerts by Horan and Taylor Swift – Styles’s former girlfriend – had brought legions more Harries to the once-sleepy village. Stephens, of Network Rail, rejected the accusation that the firm was being a party-pooper by fencing off the arches. “We’re trying to promote it in a safe and sustainable way that isn’t going to cause vandalism to a Grade II-listed structure,” he said. “By fencing the viaduct off, we are actually preserving messages that have already been left.” Now the Harries have been kept at bay, the main question is what to do once the new signature boards have been filled. It is one Network Rail will have to answer sooner than they thought. By Thursday lunchtime, dozens of fans had already tramped across muddy farmers’ fields to leave their mark at the site. “There were more people here than I thought there would be, if I’m being honest,” said Stephens."

Weird! Kamala Harris and Tim Walz gave an interview on CNN that was … radically normal. Just as she did a week ago at the Democratic national convention, the vice-president was comfortable and composed, solid and unspectacular, doing enough to clear the bar and doing herself no harm. She turned a much hyped first interview as nominee into a soon-to-be-forgotten pit stop along the campaign trail. Perhaps most important was the personality test. The old saw in presidential campaigns was: which candidate would you rather have a beer with? Harris and Walz came over as the couple you’d be fine sharing cake and coffee with at your kids’ birthday party. The same cannot be said of the former president and his running mate, JD Vance. Democrats’ bet is that Americans crave such relatability after a decade of Trump’s malignant narcissism and Joe Biden’s struggles with old age. The current president turned every interview into a nerve-wracking high-wire act. Harris was a fresh-faced model of steadiness by comparison. But as the 27-minute interview unfolded, she was notably more at ease embracing Biden and his legacy than her own historic candidacy as potentially the first Black female president. Democrats may value her loyalty in refusing to disown her boss. Republicans may scent an opportunity to portray her as Biden-lite. Perhaps Harris’s weakest answer was her first. Wearing grey and sitting in a cafe in Savannah, Georgia, she was asked by CNN’s Dana Bash: “If you are elected, what would you do on day one in the White House?” Harris replied: “Well, there are a number of things. I will tell you, first and foremost, one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class … ” When Bash pressed: “So, what would you do day one?”, Harris talked about the “opportunity economy”. Political consultant Frank Luntz was unimpressed, tweeting: “Her answer was so vague that it was essentially worthless. Not a good start.” Then again, when Trump was asked the same question about day one, he said he would be a dictator. So there’s that. Harris was then asked about her policy reversals on fracking and the Green New Deal. She avoided a gaffe but gave an answer that bordered on a wonky word salad: “I have always believed – and I have worked on it – that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time.” She did better explaining a U-turn on decriminalising illegal border crossings, pointing out that she is the only person in the race who has prosecuted transnational criminal organisations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings, then pivoting to accuse Trump of sinking border security legislation. “He killed the bill – a border security bill that would have put 1,500 more agents on the border.” Policy is often a surrogate for values. Harris’s central message on her policy shifts: “My values have not changed.” Translation: you know and I know that some policies have to be tweaked, or made vague, if I want to win swing state voters. Addressing a national audience, rather than a rally, Harris was also careful not to alienate the type of Republicans who supported Nikki Haley. She said she would appoint a Republican to her cabinet if elected, though she did not have a particular name in mind. “I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion.” When Bash asked her about Trump’s questioning of Harris’s racial identity, she could have unleashed a long and angry tirade about his history of racism. Instead she wisely chose the pithy response: “Same old tired playbook, next question please.” Bash asked: “That’s it?” Harris confirmed: “That’s it.” Sign up to The Stakes — US Election Edition The Guardian guides you through the chaos of a hugely consequential presidential election after newsletter promotion This might offer a clue as to her strategy for next month’s presidential debate: cut Trump down to size with a short sharp line, then move on to her own more optimistic, future-facing agenda. Call it the “Honey, I Shrunk the Trump” approach. Much was made of the fact that Walz was involved in the interview. In the end, Harris got the lion’s share, with Walz looking down at the ground during the tougher moments. She seemed to watch him with a benign, proud smile. But when Bash put it to Walz that he once said he carried weapons in war, even though he never deployed in a war zone, Walz parried: “Yeah ... in this case, this was after a school shooting ... and my wife, the English teacher, told me my grammar is not always correct.” It just felt like a dodge. The interview ended with Bash asking about a photo of one of Harris’s young grandnieces watching as she delivered her address to the last week’s convention – and the historic nature of candidate. Harris seemed to think cautiously, as if wary of an identity politics trap. “I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender,” she said. “But I did see that photograph, and I was deeply touched by it.” Just like her convention speech, it was a far cry from the “I’m with her” chants of Hillary Clinton’s effort to smash the glass ceiling eight years ago. Harris is adopting a show, don’t tell approach. That left viewers not entirely clear how a Harris administration would differ from a Biden one. But they may also have no doubt that Harris and Walz would represent a return to the politics of normal."

With just over two months until voters will head to the polls on 5 November – and even less time before some will mail in their ballots – the Democratic candidates for president and vice-president made good on a promise to speak more candidly about how they will tackle the US’s most pressing problems. But this interview was about more than just policies and priorities. For weeks, Republicans and members of the media have called for the nominees to open themselves up to questions, especially the vice-president, who has for the most part sidestepped unscripted moments in the six weeks since the president ended his bid for re-election and endorsed her. Analysts and opponents were watching Thurday’s interview closely for new insights into how a Harris administration would approach the presidency, how the candidates interact with one another, and how she would respond in more candid moments. Here’s what we learned: Bash pushed Harris on how voters should view some key shifts on important policy positions over the years, including on immigration and the climate crisis. Harris responded resolutely saying her “values have not changed” but explained that experience has provided some new insights. “As president I will not ban fracking,” Harris said, reversing a position she expressed during her first bid for the presidency. Explaining that she now believes a “thriving clean energy economy” can be built without a ban, Harris highlighted achievements from the Biden administration, including the US’s landmark climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, that have helped set the course. “The climate crisis is real, it is an urgent matter,” she said. “I am very clear about where I stand.” She also spoke about her work on the border and how she plans to address the immigration crisis. “I believe we have laws that have to be followed and enforced,” she said, adding that she is the only person in the race who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations, work she did as California’s attorney general. If Harris is elected president, she will start by working to strengthen the middle class with a strategy she is calling “The Opportunity Economy”. Building from “Bidenomics” – a platform her predecessor used to move away from trickle-down policies that favor the wealthy and instead grow the economy “from the middle out and the bottom up – Harris outlined her plan to help struggling families. “People are ready for a new way forward,” she said, highlighting that she hopes to bring down costs of everyday goods with key investments, cracking down on price gouging, and expanding the child tax credit. She also reiterated her plan to secure $25,000 in assistance for first-time homebuyers. While she agreed with Bash that prices remain higher than they were during the Trump presidency, she argued that she and Biden ensured the country recovered from the Covid-19 crisis. “Bidenomics is a success,” she said. “There’s more to do – but that’s good work.” “Israel has a right to defend itself – we would,” Harris said, emphasizing that she is “unequivocal” in Israel’s defense and that that position would not change. But, she added: “How it does so matters.” Harris told Bash she supports a two-state solution where Palestinians have “security, self determination, and dignity”, and said she is focused on both getting the remaining hostages out and a ceasefire. “Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed,” she said. “We have got to get a deal done. This war must end.” Through much of the interview, Harris’s running mate Tim Walz nodded in support while she detailed their platform. But Bash had questions for him too, specifically about claims he has made in the past and corrections his campaign has had to make about them. Walz served in the army national guard for 24 years and retired in 2005 to run for Congress, nearly a year before his unit deployed to Iraq. He has been criticized by Republicans who first questioned his decision to depart before his unit deployed, and then scrutinized for a statement he made about “weapons of war” that implied he’d been involved in active combat. Walz also incorrectly described the type of fertility treatments he and his wife sought in their effort to conceive, several times referring to their reliance on IVF. He later clarified they actually used another common fertility procedure called IUI, or intrauterine insemination, which does not involve creating or discarding embryos and is not a target for anti-abortion legislators. “My record speaks for itself,” he said. “I certainly own my mistakes when I make them … I won’t apologize for speaking passionately – whether it’s about guns in schools or protecting reproductive rights – the contrast could not be clearer.” “We were sitting down to do a puzzle,” Harris said with a big smile. Before Thursday’s interview, little was known about how she came to learn that Biden would be withdrawing from the race. She described a family breakfast with her “baby nieces”, complete with pancakes and second-servings of bacon, that had just wrapped up when the phone began to ring. “It was Joe Biden. He told me what he decided to do,” she said, adding that he quickly offered his support for her candidacy. “My first thought was not about me – it was about him,” she said. “I think history is going to show a number of things about Joe Biden’s presidency,” Harris added. “He puts the American people first.” Bash also asked about the now viral New York Times photo of young Amara Ajagu, one of Harris’s young grandnieces, watching Harris accept her party’s nomination, and what it means for her as a woman of color. Donald Trump had previously questioned her racial identity, making comments at the National Association of Black Journalists convention saying she “happened to turn Black”.

Near the central market, in a spacious building of six rooms and a large hall, Alhan al-Salmani, who has six children and a harrowing history, runs her kitchen, Al-Eiz. The place is full of women. Twelve are sitting on the ground next to a vast tanoor, a traditional clay oven. On the right, pots full of rice and meat simmer on the fire. The sun’s glow lights the scene, while the smell of kubba – an Iraqi dish of minced meat packed in rice – draws you in. It takes time to prepare kubba and around 200 plates a day are made and sent out. Salmani, 50, manager and chef, stands, gently offering guidance. Al-Eiz is Qaim’s first food takeaway business, supplying meals to farmers, militia from Iraq’s Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) and other soldiers, workers at non-governmental organisations, and the 3,000 households headed by women, mainly widows, who live in the town. People phone in their orders and either pick their food up or taxi drivers are engaged to collect and deliver the plates. Khitam Hammad, who works for the International Rescue Committee, gets her lunch from Al-Eiz. “Alhan’s food reminds me of my grandmother’s food,” she says. The cooks start work at 7am. They make timmen qouzi – braised lamb with rice cooked over a wood fire – and dolma – vine leaves and vegetables such as aubergines, courgettes, onions, tomatoes and peppers stuffed with a flavourful mixture of rice, meat and herbs. Salmani will work in the kitchen for 10 hours. “I don’t get tired,” she says. When Salmani was 15, her father forced her out of school to be married. “I enjoyed going to school, reading books and drawing,” she says. “I dreamed of being a teacher one day.” Instead she watched other girls her age continue at school, as she began cooking, cleaning and, before long, taking care of her own children. Salmani became a widow at 30 after her husband, an army officer, was killed in the battle of Baghdad in 2003, at the start of the US-led invasion of Iraq. She was left as the sole carer of their three children: Abdullah, Mohammed and little Omnia, who was four months old. “Being a widow is a stigma in my family,” Salmani says. “I didn’t choose to be a widow, but my brother wanted me to remarry, so he beat me.” She was pushed into another marriage, this time as a second wife. She began to suffer from anxiety, depression and loneliness. But, she says: “This was God’s will; Alhamdulillah, thanks be to God.” Ten years later, Iraq faced another invasion, this time from Islamic State. In 2014, when the Islamist group attacked Qaim, Salmani was pregnant. There was little food and she stayed at home while the Iraqi army and IS fought. “They were long, dark nights filled with fear and with only one meal of bread during the day. This is how I lived for six months.” The family finally escaped, fleeing to Baghdad in the night. “It was a time of adversity. I lived with my co-wife in a modest rented house, but my husband had no money.” Salmani learned to cook from her mother. Like many Iraqi women, she would spend hours in the kitchen, preparing meals for the family. This was the foundation of what would become another journey. She convinced her co-wife to join her, and they sold fresh homemade food from their kitchen to shops and schools nearby.

Once back in Qaim, the family found their house had been destroyed. “When life gets hard, you must be harder,” says Salmani. “I rebuilt my house and started my project, Al-Eiz kitchen. I never gave up.” Al-Eiz means dignity, and the kitchen is a successful business, employing women who might otherwise struggle to find employment. But Salmani has also established Al-Gharbia Women’s Group, which collects donations to prepare and distribute food to widows in Qaim. In March this year, it delivered food to 125 families in Qaim. “I understand how it is hard to be a widow,” she says. “I believe that my purpose in life is to support widows in my community. I am trying to help them through offering employment opportunities in Al-Eiz kitchen or by the voluntary food campaigns.” Salmani has restarted the studies she had to abandon as a child. She is working towards a fine arts degree and has ambitions to one day open a wedding hall. “Al-Eiz hall,” she says with a smile. But as she talks, the woman who never gets tired has orders coming in and she returns to her team to prepare the food that will soon be in many Qaim homes.

As the doors opened to customers on Thursday lunchtime, staff and customers alike were bristling at the news that the government is considering banning smoking in outdoor areas such as beer gardens, and outdoor areas at clubs and restaurants. “It just seems like a really bad idea. I don’t see how it can be good for hospitality,” said Matthew Brigham, part owner and manager of the Dark Horse craft beer bar. “I think it would be horrible to police, for one. And I think it would lead to more people drinking on the streets, and more people drinking at home – and drinking cheap booze at home is more linked to alcoholism.” The outdoor area in front of the pub where people are allowed to smoke is decked with fairy lights, heat lamps and picnic benches. Smokers, and increasingly vapers, can be seen on any given night of the week. “There are still a lot of people who smoke, although it’s nowhere near what it used to be,” said Brigham. “I think stopping kids from taking up smoking seems like a really good idea. But this seems like an unnecessary impact on a sector that’s really struggling. Are they going to do anything positive with business rates or tax breaks to help?” Just around the corner, Sean Short, 54, was smoking on the pavement outside a Wetherspoon’s pub – there is some suggestion that pavements outside venues could also fall under a new ban. “I think it’s ridiculous. As if there’s not enough pubs being closed anyway at the minute,” he said. “I can understand them banning it outside hospitals, that makes sense, but not outside pubs.” He said an outdoor ban would not stop him from coming to the pub, but he could see that it would for other people, especially when alcohol is cheaper to buy in supermarkets. “I would also feel for the staff, the last thing they want to be doing is coming outside and telling someone to put out a cigarette,” he said. “And then they say it’s about the secondhand smoke, but you’ve got diesel cars driving past constantly.” Studies have shown concentrations of secondhand smoke are usually lower outdoors than inside, although in certain environmental conditions they can be comparable, and the NHS advises that any level of secondhand smoke inhalation is harmful. Dan Levy, 43, on a lunch break with work colleagues, said: “As someone who smokes but is trying to stop, I can see how it would help. And I think that’s the point, I can see the benefits. . “But I can see both sides. There was already a big impact on attendance at pubs and social clubs after the smoking ban, and this will only impact that further in an industry at a time when they’re really struggling. It will really hit the pubs with big beer gardens.” His colleague Sammy-Jo Ottley, 30, said: “I’m not a smoker and [people smoking outdoors] doesn’t bother me. I’ve got asthma, but it’s not at the top of my list. If there’s a smoking area out the back, I just wouldn’t go out there.” She added: “I think it will impact businesses massively, because if you suddenly can’t smoke somewhere, then you just won’t bother going.” She added that the previous government’s plans, now taken up by Labour, to stop anyone who was born on or after 1 January 2009 from buying cigarettes mean that people smoking in public spaces will eventually disappear anyway. “I’ve got a three-year-old, and I’d like to think he would never be able to buy cigarettes. And then there won’t be an issue,” she said. Connor Wild, the general manager of the Prince of Wales pub, said he was particularly annoyed at the proposals, having just done a major revamp of the beer garden to fit current legislation on outdoor smoking areas. It is the biggest pub garden in the area, complete with a cocktail bar, fire pits and live music at weekends. “If people are going to smoke, they’re going to smoke. If it’s an outdoor area, I don’t see how it’s enforceable,” he said. “You’re not going to get people who have drank in here for 40-50 years who are smokers suddenly stopping smoking because the government said so. Are we expected to go round taking cigarettes out of people’s mouths?” But that is what happened when they banned smoking indoors, a colleague reminded him. “I suppose,” he said. “I just don’t think this is a good idea.”"

You just want to be recognised in the streets.’ So it never even occurred to me to be on album covers, because I’m not a weirdo.” She sighs, catching herself. “Not that people that do that are …” Deal has evaded being that weirdo ever since. The 63-year-old is the star most likely to “show up in sweats”, a self-taught producer who used to solder her own cables. While many of her peers struck out on their own – even her sister – she has always had a band mentality. After the Breeders went on hiatus in 1994, she briefly flirted with going solo. But even that became a band (the Amps) that turned back into the Breeders. “You know, you’re right!” she says. “Kelley and Jim [MacPherson, drums] wormed their way in.” That said, they never quite regained momentum. “Everybody needed a break. And there were things going on that made it difficult. There were struggles …” Well-publicised ones, too: addiction, arrests, fallouts, rehab. “Exactly,” she adds. “But I’m always going to keep writing.” That writing has become a solo album – her first, Nobody Loves You More, due in November. Deal, finally, is on the sleeve. She agreed to it on the basis that it would be “a good shot”, so she enlisted the artist Alex Da Corte to take her picture: on a podium, out at sea, with a guitar, an amp and a flamingo for company. It’s inspired by a photo of the Dutch performance artist Bas Jan Ader’s attempt to cross the Atlantic in 1975. He set sail from Massachusetts in a tiny boat “and they never saw him again”, says Deal. “He’s dead because he’s fantasised this journey.” It’s a bleak image, but one typical of Deal’s dark humour as she sips on a Sprite one afternoon in London, clad not in sweats but smart 50s-style slacks and a shirt. She is enjoying the promo cycle without the band so far, but is also missing their input. “I’ll send them stuff anyway, like: ‘Do you like this photo they want to use?’ I think Kelley wishes I would just lose her number.” This period is perhaps one of her busiest since the Breeders reformed with their classic lineup in 2013: Deal and Kelley, the British bassist Josephine Wiggs and – after he and Kim didn’t speak for 15 years, although neither of them can remember why – Macpherson. The group played a scene-stealing Glastonbury slot in June and, as of this year, are the only band who can say they have supported Nirvana and Olivia Rodrigo. The US pop star has said of Deal: “I thought Kim was the coolest girl in the world,” while the Breeders’ sibling harmonies, freewheeling playfulness and slacker cool have influenced Rodrigo’s sound. So it feels like the right time for an artistic statement, however much that phrase would probably make Deal shudder. She has been writing new material since about 2011, when she returned from Pixies’ Lost Cities tour and then quit. Some of it became a lo-fi 7in series two years later, which she posted out by hand, and some made it on to the Breeders’ last album, All Nerve, in 2018. The rest eventually became Nobody Loves You More, she says, for practical reasons. “I thought: nobody likes to have to walk up to their stereo and flip over [the record after] three and a half minutes, that’s kind of a drag, so I could put them all on an album.” The Breeders have been performing a few of Deal’s solo songs live and all members except Wiggs (due to bass parts that had to be redone) play on the record. Why didn’t these songs just go to the band? She gives the simple reason that she started playing some of them on the ukulele, to which Wiggs would have said – Deal puts on her plummiest English impression of disgust – “Absolutely not!” Instead, Nobody Loves You More was recorded across different studios with a slew of old friends, including Josh Klinghoffer, Raymond McGinley of Teenage Fanclub, Slint’s Britt Walford and the late Steve Albini. There are fragments of biographical details throughout, but Deal shrouds them in her usual surreal imagery. In the words of Albini, who recorded much of the album, Deal makes “intense, personal little masterpieces that reward repeated listening like a great novel does reading”. Nobody Loves You More channels classic American sounds: there are moments of tender country and sublime Rat Pack strings and doo-wop; the sweetest melodies, but also left-turns such as the dance-punk of Crystal Breath, a rejected theme for the aerobics comedy series Physical. Making it was unmooring at points, to say the least. Deal’s mother, father, uncle and aunt all died within a year of each other, between 2019 and 2020. Their family was close: when her mother, Ann, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2002, Deal moved back to Dayton, Ohio, to help care for her. Her parents were incredibly supportive of their daughters’ careers: Ann would often capture their vocals on a reel-to-reel tape recorder. Their father, Robert, meanwhile, once drove the Breeders around on tour with Nirvana (and listened to Ray Charles on headphones the whole way). Deal would later return the favour, ferrying her elderly parents down to the Florida Keys for holidays. She came to see Florida as a writing retreat and went to stay there alone at the start of 2020. No sooner had she settled in than Deal was called back to Dayton as Ann’s condition worsened; she died shortly after. “It had been a long time coming. I would have liked it to have happened way earlier,” she admits. “She was pretty ravaged physically by that time, let alone mentally.” After her mother’s death, Deal returned to the Keys. Then – she delivers each line like she is telling a ghost story around a campfire – “Covid hits. They shut off the two-lane road to get out. I get trapped in Florida for months with the Trump flags. No neighbours, no friends. It felt harrowing walking down the street.” During this unnerving period, she cut a lot of the demos that ended up on the album, this staunchly analogue musician having begrudgingly learned Pro Tools with a friend over FaceTime. The aggressive Big Ben Beat bristles with the frustration of that time, based on a backing track sent to Deal by Fay Milton and Ayse Hassan of 180dB (and, before that, Savages). Other songs are sunnier, such as Summerland, which she sketched out on that ukulele – a gift from Albini after the Deal sisters played at his wedding in Hawaii. “We were doing the bridal march and sang a Dolly Parton song,” she says. Albini engineered much of Nobody Loves You More, while Deal produced. He used many of the same techniques he deployed on Pixies’ Surfer Rosa in 1988. Yet, on Summerland, he recorded an orchestra in a day; on Coast, the Chicago marching band Mucca Pazza. “He’s better with me solo,” declares Deal. “He was more open to being adventurous.” Albini died suddenly of a heart attack in May, at 61. “It just devastated an entire community,” says Deal. “He was, like, a year younger than me, so it was really surprising.” She fights back tears. “I’m sorry. I think I’m tired. Sorry.” Understandably, Nobody Loves You More grapples with mortality. “It has to come through,” she says. “I’m getting older, too.” There is a sweet nod to her mother on Are You Mine? “One time, she stopped me in the hallway and said: ‘Are you mine?’ There was something inside her that knew that [we were] connected, but you could see her trying to piece it together.” After Ann’s death, Deal felt a release. “I remember thinking: no prescriptions to pick up, I don’t have to watch out for a fall. It’s like I’m a teenager. I could even move house if I wanted to.” Other influences seeped through while she drove around in her dad’s Cadillac, playing an old easy-listening compilation. The tracklist included George Jones’s He Stopped Loving Her Today, a song that was played at her dad’s funeral. Deal became “fixated” by crooners such as Jones and Waylon Jennings, “these old outlaw boys with the mutton chops, aviator glasses, they’re on their third wife”. Does she consider herself an outlaw? “I have no idea … it sounds good when you say it like that,” she says. She was drawn to their “sad songs, with regret”. “I have regrets, of course,” says Deal. She rarely explains her songs, but brings up the lyric “I really should duck and roll out / Out of my life” from Coast, one of several on the album that suggest wanting to start anew. “I guess that is wanting to disappear from the dumbness that I just did,” she nods. Like what? “Oh, 1997, ’98, ’99, 2000, 2001 and most of 2002.” This was the period in which she experienced substance abuse and had a tumultuous time making the third Breeders album, Title TK, then got sober. “I would like to do those years again. I. Did. Not. Like. Them,” she enunciates. “They were a waste of time.” She says there is something about the idea of defeat that she keeps returning to in her solo music, although she can’t put her finger on it. “I’m intrigued by failure, I swear. I don’t know why … Failure is more comfortable.” More comfortable than success? “No, I don’t know if it’s failure versus success. There’s just something about trying to do something and then just getting utterly clobbered by life.” The Breeders never matched their critical acclaim with commercial domination like their arena-filling friends Soundgarden and Nirvana. The Guardian’s Alexis Petridis once wrote that “a sense of ‘What if?’” hangs over Deal’s career – that if certain stars had aligned, and egos kept at bay, then perhaps she would have been a bigger name. (There is an oft-repeated story that Kurt Cobain said he wished Deal had been allowed to write more songs for Pixies – she penned their most memorable number, Gigantic – which alluded to rivalry with the frontman, Black Francis). Yet Deal remains enormously influential: the Breeders’ sound echoes across modern indie-rock and pop, from Courtney Barnett and Waxahatchee to the Linda Lindas and, of course, Rodrigo. Ask Deal what she thinks of thousands of screaming teens discovering her music on Rodrigo’s Guts tour, though, and she is typically self-deprecating. “Somebody said to me recently: ‘You’re gonna be the first band they’ve ever seen.’ They’re seeing Olivia Rodrigo – they’re not seeing us at all. But they do feel the vibe. So that’s a positive thing.” She is, however, happy to be thought of as an alt-rock icon. “I love it. Although the word ‘alt’ does leave a bad taste in my mouth. I’m from Ohio,” she says, where people would sneer: “‘Alternative to what? Good music?’” But she hasn’t considered her legacy just yet. “I don’t think people look upon their own legacy, do they?” For now, as with its marooned cover art, Nobody Loves You More is Deal’s voyage into the unknown. Will she tour? “I would like to play some shows, for sure,” she says. “But there has to be a demand … I spent my time in bands, not just me, so I don’t know if there’s really any: ‘Oh, Kim Deal’s playing down the road, let’s go watch her.’” Does she know whether there will be new Breeders material, at least? She reverts to her happy place, which may or may not be taking the mick. “There’s a Christmas song, I swear to God. You know, it’s not like Merry Christmas, but it’s of the season. Should we be a band that has a Christmas song? Can you imagine Josephine? ‘Absolutely not!’”  Nobody Loves You More is released via 4AD on 22 November  This interview was updated on 30 August 2024 to correct the release date and album personnel: it features Josh Klinghoffer, not John Frusciante as previously stated."

Does she consider herself an outlaw? “I have no idea … it sounds good when you say it like that,” she says. She was drawn to their “sad songs, with regret”. “I have regrets, of course,” says Deal. She rarely explains her songs, but brings up the lyric “I really should duck and roll out / Out of my life” from Coast, one of several on the album that suggest wanting to start anew. “I guess that is wanting to disappear from the dumbness that I just did,” she nods. Like what? “Oh, 1997, ’98, ’99, 2000, 2001 and most of 2002.” This was the period in which she experienced substance abuse and had a tumultuous time making the third Breeders album, Title TK, then got sober. “I would like to do those years again. I. Did. Not. Like. Them,” she enunciates. “They were a waste of time.” She says there is something about the idea of defeat that she keeps returning to in her solo music, although she can’t put her finger on it. “I’m intrigued by failure, I swear. I don’t know why … Failure is more comfortable.” More comfortable than success? “No, I don’t know if it’s failure versus success. There’s just something about trying to do something and then just getting utterly clobbered by life.” The Breeders never matched their critical acclaim with commercial domination like their arena-filling friends Soundgarden and Nirvana. The Guardian’s Alexis Petridis once wrote that “a sense of ‘What if?’” hangs over Deal’s career – that if certain stars had aligned, and egos kept at bay, then perhaps she would have been a bigger name. (There is an oft-repeated story that Kurt Cobain said he wished Deal had been allowed to write more songs for Pixies – she penned their most memorable number, Gigantic – which alluded to rivalry with the frontman, Black Francis). Yet Deal remains enormously influential: the Breeders’ sound echoes across modern indie-rock and pop, from Courtney Barnett and Waxahatchee to the Linda Lindas and, of course, Rodrigo. Ask Deal what she thinks of thousands of screaming teens discovering her music on Rodrigo’s Guts tour, though, and she is typically self-deprecating. “Somebody said to me recently: ‘You’re gonna be the first band they’ve ever seen.’ They’re seeing Olivia Rodrigo – they’re not seeing us at all. But they do feel the vibe. So that’s a positive thing.” She is, however, happy to be thought of as an alt-rock icon. “I love it. Although the word ‘alt’ does leave a bad taste in my mouth. I’m from Ohio,” she says, where people would sneer: “‘Alternative to what? Good music?’” But she hasn’t considered her legacy just yet. “I don’t think people look upon their own legacy, do they?” For now, as with its marooned cover art, Nobody Loves You More is Deal’s voyage into the unknown. Will she tour? “I would like to play some shows, for sure,” she says. “But there has to be a demand … I spent my time in bands, not just me, so I don’t know if there’s really any: ‘Oh, Kim Deal’s playing down the road, let’s go watch her.’” Does she know whether there will be new Breeders material, at least? She reverts to her happy place, which may or may not be taking the mick. “There’s a Christmas song, I swear to God. You know, it’s not like Merry Christmas, but it’s of the season. Should we be a band that has a Christmas song? Can you imagine Josephine? ‘Absolutely not!’”  Nobody Loves You More is released via 4AD on 22 November  This interview was updated on 30 August 2024 to correct the release date and album personnel: it features Josh Klinghoffer, not John Frusciante as previously stated."

We’ll be going somewhere, and often running late (which will usually be his fault, too). I’ll be speed-walking or regaling him with a story only to turn around and see that Derren is way behind me on the ground, tying his shoelaces again – or just completely out of my sight. It’s embarrassing. It means I’ll have just been talking to myself for who knows how long. I’ll admonish him when he catches up to me, and say: “Can you just let me know where you are?” but he just laughs. I think Derren has an aversion to double-knotting his shoelaces just because I’ve asked him to do it. I feel that it could be a very simple fix. I’m not a double knot purist, but you need to understand when a situation calls for a certain knot. I double-knot the shoelaces on my boots for example, because the laces need the extra help, but my Converse shoes work fine with single knots. Derren, meanwhile, laces up his shoes very loosely – I think he’s got weak fingers – so he really should tie a double knot every time. I have told him this, but he says he doesn’t like undoing them at the end of the day. We’ve been together five years, but we were long distance for the first four of those so I didn’t notice the trailing laces. It only became apparent when we moved in together a year ago. We don’t have a car, so we walk or take the bus and train often. We’ve almost missed trains because of Derren’s loose shoelaces. His laces are also dirty because they’re always undone. I guess he can be a bit slovenly. But the main issue is the embarrassment of me walking along talking to myself for a full 20 seconds when he’s nowhere to be seen. I’ve suggested changing his shoe style, but the only slip-on ones he has are ugly and also full of holes. Derren likes the simplicity of single knots, and says retying his laces offers rare moments of pause in his day. While I have a lot of time for the idea of taking a moment to appreciate the world, his constant lace-tying does not give us rest; it stresses us out. It would be nice if Derren could let me know every time he pauses to retie his laces – or, ideally, change his lace-tying technique completely. I love coming home and kicking my shoes off while everyone around me is toiling with knots Even if I stopped and told Margy every time I was going to redo my laces, she would still admonish me. At the moment she says: “Derren, why don’t you double-knot your laces, you idiot!” I don’t think that would change if I gave her warning. I would rather just bend down and hope she doesn’t see. Seek forgiveness, not permission. We do actually communicate really well in other areas of our relationship, and always have done, but Margy hates that I don’t tell her this one thing. I don’t even think it’s a big deal. I just don’t want to waste time double-tying my shoelaces every day, but she thinks I waste more time bending down to retie them. That’s debatable. My trainers have particularly slippery laces, but it happens with all shoes with varying frequency. People have stood on my laces in the crowd or whatever, but that’s their fault. I probably bend down to tie my laces five times a day or more, but it doesn’t bother me. Sometimes you tie the right single knot and it’s fine; other times they come undone. The reason I don’t double knot is because I find it so annoying to untie. I love coming home and kicking my shoes off quickly while everyone else fiddles with complicated-looking knots. I think: “Ha!” A single knot is superior, in my view. We’re not meant to meticulously unpick shoelaces. I also think bending down to tie my laces connects me to the world. I might be deep in thought, or listening to a podcast, and when my laces come undone, I’ll stop to pause and bend down. By the time I stand up I might have a different perspective on the world. It’s a moment of meditation. Margy thinks it’s funny that I have a book about knots. I’m not a knot enthusiast, but I have experimented with different knots. I think whoever invented the double knot thought they were cleverer than the single knot guy, but they actually made it more complicated. A single knot pulls apart more easily than a double knot and is perfect. I guess I could tell Margy more often when I’m about to tie my laces, but she could join me in the single knot revolution. We could meditate from the ground together. Should Derren double up for Margy? While both Margy and Derren have their faults (her lack of patience and his infuriatingly hippyish attitude to time spent tying his shoes) Derren is a grown man who can’t tie his shoes properly. A double knot is a fundamental step in shoe-tying, not an optional extra.Henry, 23 This is about a lack of communication: Margy talking to herself while Derren daydreams. But she only realises it when he has to tie up his laces and there’s no physical body to talk at. Also, “weak fingers …” Ouch. Definitely not a laces problem, is it?Carly, 38 Derren could buy laces that are less likely to loosen, but if he lets Margy know he’s stopping, it’s minimal harm. Rita, 55 Being in Margy’s (securely tied) shoes would drive me mad. If something’s upsetting your partner, there’s usually a quick and simple fix – by refusing to use it, you’re being selfish and awkward. Derren can “meditate” when he’s untying his shoes at the end of the day – or learn to tie a knot that a) works, and b) unties easily.Hannah, 47 I’d agree with Derren that noteworthy moments happen during a brief pause, and typically people are rushing around and miss things. A moment of meditation sounds beautiful. Margy could do with practising a bit of gratitude, and realising she’s with someone lovely and thoughtful.Jamie, 34 In our online poll, tell us: should Derren embrace the double-knot?

One contributor dreams of being fed chocolate by the Hogwarts potion master. Another longs to have sex with her office door knob. Women are still seen as less sexual than men, but this book attests to a vivid imaginative hinterland, where the desires are far more inventive than the “Milf” and “cheerleader” tropes that dominate man-made porn. In one particularly detailed submission, a woman daydreams about breastfeeding an attractive cashier at the supermarket. The fantasies in this book are sometimes shocking, but hard limits were imposed during the selection process to remove anything that, if acted out in real life, would be illegal. Want is edited by Gillian Anderson, who has restyled herself as a sort of sexual agony aunt after playing a charismatic therapist in Netflix’s Sex Education. In her introduction, Anderson explains how she struggled with the less straightforwardly empowering submissions. Some did make the final cut, but they are punctuated by anxious self-justification. One woman interrupts her fantasy about being held captive by a group of robbers to insist that she is “a feminist”, and that the imaginary robbers have her “consent”. The disclaimers suggest that some of the women are editing themselves as they write. It’s a shame, because the best contributions in this book – such as the one about breastfeeding a cashier – are erotic precisely because they are a little depraved. Want is framed as a kind of sequel to My Secret Garden, Nancy Friday’s 1973 collection of anonymous female fantasies, but that was a much more unfiltered exploration of desire. There were chapters titled Incest and Rape, as well as a section called The Zoo, where women imagined having sex with their pets. We may think we have become more sexually open in the past 50 years, but what was possible in 1973 is simply unpublishable today. Want seems hyperaware of its place in a culture that is liberal enough to produce a children’s show called Sex Education, but also seeks to tidy up sex and make it palatable. We have gained a more nuanced understanding of harmful power dynamics in sexual relationships, but one consequence of that progress is an impulse to prune even our most secret sexual dreams, if the sex we are dreaming of doesn’t conform to certain standards. I’m not disputing the importance of consent and safe sex practices in real life – but the crucial point is that this is supposed to be fantasy, not reality. Sign up to Bookmarks Discover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories. Literary delights delivered direct to you after newsletter promotion As a result, some of the stories in this book feel too self-censored to be truly erotic. If you’re looking to get off, Nancy Friday’s daring original is more likely to do the trick. Even so, Want makes for addictive reading. More compelling than the fantasies themselves are the frequent glimpses into the women’s real worlds. One contributor confesses that she fantasises about her partner’s death – she longs to be free, because she has never explored her true feelings for women. Another writes that she brings herself to orgasm by thinking about her husband cheating on her. He has been unfaithful in reality, so every time she does this, she cries. The real-life loneliness conveyed here is much rawer than the wish-fulfilment. At its best, Want gives you privileged access into the most painful, truthful corners of these women’s lives. Anderson tells us on the fourth page that she has hidden her own entry somewhere within the collection, which invites you to play a guessing game. Is she the door knob? The Potter fan? The woman who longs for her partner to die? The idea that you might be peeping into a celebrity’s life adds a certain frisson, as you scour the pages for hints. In essence, you are invited to fantasise about her in a way that feels voyeuristic, or least morally ambiguous. But then, perhaps that’s what great fantasy always needs – a dash of moral ambiguity.

We were singing Bette Midler’s The Rose around Mum’s bed, and none of us can hold a tune to save our lives, but we were belting it out and all crying our eyes out and laughing.” Finding the funny side of grief may still be considered taboo by some, but Reisinger is hoping to change that with his new film, And Mrs. It stars Aisling Bea and Colin Hanks as Gemma and Nathan, a betrothed couple whose big day is thwarted when Nathan dies suddenly just before it. Gemma decides to press on with the wedding regardless, determined to marry her deceased partner (an act known as necrogamy). The film is especially personal for Reisinger, who was preparing for the film’s pre-production when his mum died of Covid. But he soon realised he wasn’t alone in his grief. Bea’s father had died from suicide when she was a child, Hanks lost his mother in his early 20s and Billie Lourd, who plays Nathan’s wayward sister, Audrey, lost her mother (Carrie Fisher) and her grandmother (Debbie Reynolds) within 48 hours of each other in 2016. As production progressed, the set became a cathartic and often joyous space in which the cast and crew got to share their stories of loss. “Death was all around the film,” says Hanks when I speak to him on a video call. “I was unfortunate enough to have had several people close to me die around that time, including someone who was like family to me. And then, while we were filming, the queen died! So it felt like all that was very much part of the film’s DNA.” He says his initial conversation with Reisinger to discuss the movie was scheduled to last half an hour, but the pair ended up embarking on an “insanely personal” chat that reached the three-hour mark. Does Hanks also believe in laughter as a way to deal with grief? “Absolutely. They don’t call it church laughter for nothing; when you’re in church, that’s when you laugh the hardest. And it’s the same with grief.” The absurdity of grief was fertile ground for laughter on set. Reisinger recalls Lourd telling him how, after her mum and her grandmother died, she was inundated with books on grief, with friends popping around to deliver a new one on a daily basis. “She also hated people saying she’d ‘lost’ her mum. She would say: ‘I didn’t lose her! She’s not wandering around a car park somewhere; she’s dead!’ I guess we say these stupid platitudes because we have no language.” It makes sense that And Mrs is set in the UK, what with our stiff upper lips. “Does this film make as much sense in Los Angeles, where everyone is in therapy and there’s not as much repressed emotion?” asks Reisinger. “I don’t know! But New Yorkers have seen it and they were bawling their eyes out.” And Mrs has a keen eye for the details of mourning. We see Gemma in a trance as funeral directors attempt to upsell her on coffin wood. We are reminded of the unavoidable list of admin that has to get done when a loved one dies. Will a grieving family remember to cancel the stripper for the hen party? Then there is the horribly familiar funeral celebrant, who clearly has no idea what the departed person was like (a cameo from Paul Kaye, who ruins Nathan’s ceremony by making ill-advised Auschwitz jokes and telling the mourners: “Four little letters bring us together and make the world a more beautiful place … MDMA”). Reisinger remembers having to snatch the microphone from someone making an inappropriately personal speech at his mum’s funeral. More poignant is the way Hanks appears throughout as a ghost-like Nathan, subtly guiding the choices Gemma makes. It reminds us that, even when someone dies, they are not gone from your life. Hanks says he recognises the experience: “I remember a very dear friend of mine dying and, because of work commitments, I wasn’t able to attend his memorial service. At first, it felt a little as if he had just disappeared. But one thing about him was he always had these beer koozies with him, and so over time I began collecting them, almost as a tribute to him. Sometimes, people will say to me: why do you have so many of these freakin’ beer koozies?! And I’ll say: let me tell you a story about my good friend Rio.” Reisinger says: “Hey, look, I can’t watch the film. I get to the end and I’m in pieces, you know? I think, once you lose someone close to you, then you start to understand the concept of ghosts. Not necessarily that they’re real as in phantasmagorical, but more like … I’ll be reading something on the Athletic on my iPad, say, and then some memories will pop up with a photo of Mum. That actually just happened like 20 minutes ago.” Necrogamy may be a fringe idea in the UK – indeed, it’s not legal – but it’s better known in France, where posthumous weddings occasionally take place. Reisinger lived there for a while and cites the moving story of Etienne Cardiles, who in 2017 was granted permission to posthumously marry Xavier Jugelé, the police officer killed by a terrorist on the Champs Élysées in Paris. The film builds on the tension between Gemma’s wish to marry Nathan and her family’s increasing belief that she is mentally unwell and needs to be stopped. Reisinger says he was keen to highlight how everybody grieves differently; what seems absurd to one person is necessary to another. “Maybe we don’t have the right to say to people that you can’t marry the person you love the most in the world. Is it really more healthy to do the traditional Anglo-Saxon thing and just drink a lot? Or is it more healthy to marry the love of your life? When you put it in that context, which one is the crazy one?” Reisinger cheerfully admits that the film’s claim that a posthumous wedding could be enacted here thanks to a little-known law introduced during the Napoleonic wars to allow women to marry sweethearts who died on the battlefield is “absolute bollocks”. As he says: “That was just an elaborate excuse to involve Harriet Walter,” who steals several scenes as the lady chief justice, the most senior judge in England and Wales. The film rides an emotional crescendo, but Reisinger saves a real sucker punch for the credits, which are given over to the cast and crew to memorialise their loved ones. “I wanted it to be their film as well as mine,” he says. I wonder if the film might strike a chord now because millions of people lost loved ones unexpectedly during the pandemic. “We lost 7 million people,” says Reisinger. “And now we don’t talk about it.

If you’ve decided the time has come, there are many options to choose from, whether it’s a smartphone, a basic handset, or an upgrade to something newer. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more. From the handset to the mobile service that goes with it, and from key parental controls to how well the phone fits with the devices you already use, here are some of the things you should know before taking the plunge – including which models are the best. The best option may be a phone you already have, particularly if you are looking to replace it in the near future. With a thorough cleaning, a new battery and a new case, a hand-me-down might be the best way to give your child a phone while helping the planet and your wallet in the process, as long as it still has software support. Battery replacements typically cost £50 to £150 depending on the model and shop, and your familiarity with the way the phone works will make it easier to wipe and set up for your child. Mobile operator EE recently advised parents not to give primary school-age children their own smartphone. So if the handset is only for calls and texts for arranging pickups and emergency phone calls, then a basic “dumb” phone could be the answer. Note they only support SMS, not WhatsApp, iMessage or other messaging apps. The downside is that many dumb phones still have limited internet access, and only a handful have basic parental controls for locking down the camera, the browser and picture messaging (MMS). The lack of restrictions on things such as contacts for calls and texts may be a deal-breaker, too, so check what’s possible in the manufacturer’s help documents before you buy. Nokia makes a range of feature phones, such as the 110 4G and 225, that cost about £30 to £60. More fun ones include nostalgia models such as the remake of the Nokia 3210 or even movie tie-ins such as the recently released HMD Barbie phone. Whichever model you choose, make sure it supports 4G, as most 3G services in the UK will have been switched off by the end of 2024.

There’s a range of models at about the £80 to £180 mark. They won’t have great cameras and may be sluggish in launching and using apps, but they typically have large screens and solid battery life. Avoid models running Android Go or without access to the Play Store and Google services. In terms of software support, check how long is left. Phones at this level typically only receive two to three years of updates from their first release, not the point at which you buy it. Make sure good cases are available as children drop phones even more than adults do, and some level of water resistance is a good idea. HMD has a range of Androids available under its own or the Nokia brand, and offers longer software support than many. The HMD Pulse costs less than £100, has Android 14 with security updates until May 2027 and can be repaired at home if something gets broken. Motorola has some good-value offerings. The £130 Moto G34 has 5G, a big battery and large screen, with Android 14 and security updates until January 2027. The Galaxy A15 may be a better choice if you are a Samsung family. It costs about £170, has Android 14 with security updates until January 2029, and has lots of first- and third-party case options to choose from to make sure it’s protected.

The cheapest new iPhone is the 2022 iPhone SE at £429 from Apple or less elsewhere, which offers a solid, if expensive, route into the Apple ecosystem. Refurbished models may be more economical. The 2020 iPhone SE costs about £110 refurbished and will probably be supported with updates for at least two to three years. The base 64GB storage is a bit tight but the phone is water resistant, and there are buckets of third-party cases. A battery service from Apple for it costs £65, should that be required. For newer models with Face ID and longer support, the iPhone 13 costs from about £300 refurbished and should see four years of software support or more.

  from £354.99musicmagpie.co.uk Once you’ve chosen the right phone, it’s time to select a service provider. Most of the phone networks block 18-plus content by default over the mobile connection, but some offer more advanced controls on top, so it is worth checking they do what you need. The cheapest starter option is usually a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) sim card. All the major networks provide them with some, such as O2’s giffgaff, specialising in providing better-value packs or bundles of minutes, texts and data that you buy for a month at a time. Check the network coverage around your local area before deciding. PAYG sims are usually free, so you can always test them out first if you live in a weak signal area. For heavier users, PAYG can work out more expensive than a contract, but you can use managing credit, minutes, texts and data to teach financial responsibility. And once the credit runs out, there’s no chance of bill shock. Alternatively, a sim-only plan typically includes an allowance of minutes, texts and data on a rolling monthly, yearly or longer basis. Monthly contracts provide greater flexibility to change things but are usually a little more expensive. The best-value deals can typically be found with the smaller virtual networks, such as Tesco Mobile, Asda Mobile, Smarty, iD Mobile or Lebara – there are lot to choose from. In many cases you might be looking at spending at between £5 and £10 a month, though there are some on offer for less than that. Then there are family plans. If your family already uses one particular network for its phones, adding another line to your existing plan can be cost-effective and easy to manage with one bill. Most of the big networks provide discounts for additional lines, while some, such as EE, allow you to share data from your plan with other sims on an ad hoc basis. Some parental controls are available on all networks, though, if you need something stronger, ParentShield from Derby-based Engine Mobile promises a “child-safe” network by providing extensive control and surveillance tools. These include allowing parents to read all texts, record all calls, set alerts for concerning words or phrases in messages, block all premium-rate services and blocking usage at set times of the day or night. The plans are typically more expensive – ParentShield’s sim-only deals start at £9.99 a month – but will provide peace of mind for many parents. They won’t help restrict content while the phone is on wifi, but could be a good solution. Apple and Google provide the ability to create child accounts fthat are linked to your own account for children under 13, allowing them to use an iPhone or Android device. Which one you create will probably be based on which platform you use as the parent. For example, if you use an Android phone with a Google account, it will be much easier to manage your child’s usage as part of your family account. Even if your child is old enough to have their own account on their phone, you can apply various parental controls on either an Android phone or iPhone at setup by connecting it to your account or a family account. Both platforms can set screen time limits, block certain apps, limit age-appropriate content in the app store, put limits on permissions, such as access to the camera, and allow you to track their location. It is worth having a dig through Apple’s parental controls and Google’s Family Link guides to get the settings right. Websites of organisations such as the NSPCC and the UK Safer Internet Centre have tips and resources that can help parents."

While his lover Frieda Weekley (née von Richthofen) was trying to explain their love affair to her family in Germany, Lawrence decided to walk south across the Alps, to Como and Milan, about 230 miles, taking steamers on the rivers and lakes where possible. In 2022, I followed him with half an idea for a novel. I took the train to Konstanz and found a pretty little town of stone courtyards and half-timbered houses. But at once my reenactment ran into a hitch: Trockenheit, said the sign on the lakeshore – drought. It was August, the Rhine was unusually low, the steamers couldn’t reach Schaffhausen, only Stein am Rhein. Half the distance. Still, there was something appropriate about this. Lawrence had used his walk to observe the encroachment of industrialisation in the Alps. He was fascinated and appalled by the way people’s age-old intimacy with the land and its rhythms was being replaced by “the mechanical money principle”. Well, now we have climate change to add to our anxieties. As I boarded my paddle steamer at 9am, it was already far too hot. One of my novel’s protagonists would, I decided, be an expert on ecocriticism. Lake Constance has Austria to the east, Germany to the north and Switzerland to the south. You’re in the heart of Europe. The steamer headed west into the Rhine, which is wider and bluer than I had imagined. Bathers bobbed near the banks; men in small boats sat hunched over fishing rods. For a couple of hours, we chugged along from one fairytale village to the next. On deck people were constantly jumping to their feet to take photos. “The poignancy of the past,” Lawrence writes, “was almost unbearable, floating there in colour upon the haze of the river.” Stein am Rhein was another masterpiece of kitsch and quaint, with a cobbled marketplace and old stone fountain. I was struck by the grey and pink frescoes, recently restored, thronging a grand facade and including a sundial where the light is always at the zenith. Tourists turn their backs for selfies. “Not very real,” is Lawrence’s comment. Along the river, as I carried my pack the 12 miles to Schaffhausen, bathers were taking advantage of the absence of the steamers to drift downstream on the sluggish current, calling and waving to each other. There was a dreamy atmosphere of pleasure and denial. Beyond Schaffhausen, you have to negotiate a tangle of motorway access roads before reaching Rhine Falls, where the whole majestic river plunges23 metres in what is reputed to be the most powerful waterfall in Europe. All vantage points have been fenced off, so if you want a good view you have to pay. It’s well worth it, yet I can’t help feeling some things should be free. “Ordinary,” is Lawrence’s complaint about the next stretch of the journey, marching south. “A horrible, average, vigorous ordinariness,” he says. We’re talking carefully cultivated fields, neat rows of vines, a well-swept Swissness about the villages. I enjoyed all this, but got what he meant. Trees had tags indicating their species and date of planting. Vineyards displayed certificates of insurance against hailstorms. Everything was bureaucratised. Each farmhouse bore a date, or dates (1670, restored 1993) and there were any number of plaques telling you about a mill here, an old winepress there. As if life were a museum. Lawrence slept in the village of Eglisau. “A small forgotten wonderful world,” he finds. Certainly, it was a fabulous place to eat trout and sip fizzy Apfelschorle looking down from a wooden balcony at the strangely blue-green river in the gorge below. My main character, I’ve decided, is taking this walk to recover a romantic past; he has made the trip once before with a lover. But to what end, if, as Lawrence frequently feels, the past is so unreal when preserved in the present. On the other hand, nothing we make these days seems half so alluring as the world our forebears built. Leaving the Rhine, you pass through an endless wood planted and managed, as regular notices inform, by the Schweizerischer Forstverein. There’s only one track, for hours, arrow straight, with logs in stacks at intervals. “Mile after mile, to Zurich,” Lawrence writes, “it was just the same … utter soulless ordinariness.” And Zurich itself, when he got there, was “like a most ordinary, average, usual person in an old costume”. He couldn’t bear to spend a single night in the town. I loved it, but did notice the Swiss habit of arranging every consumer product in neat little rows: cakes and chocolates, pipes and pocketknives, herb teas, jewels, jams, each item rigorously aligned, neatly labelled, clearly priced. There was even a Condomeria, with condoms and vibrators in pink and purple ranks. I wonder what my lovesick protagonist will make of them. The next day began with a steamer trip on the Zurichsee, then a beautiful climb through dense natural woods from Adliswil to Felsenegg, where the terrace cafe at the top offered a vast panorama – “Zurich and its lake laid out before me like a relief map”, Lawrence says – and the first sight of the mountains to the south: a delicate white silhouette above blue hills promising, at last, something quite out of the ordinary. Sure enough, it was the long climb toward the Gotthard which was the climax and challenge of this trip. First, you have the hike to Lucerne, “irritating as ever,” the sublimely grumpy Lawrence decides, “like the wrapper round milk chocolate”– then a magnificent three-hour lake trip down to Flüelen in a steamer that announced it was built in 1906, hence perhaps the very boat Lawrence sailed in. The water was weirdly luminous under heavy cloud which opened up now and then on glimpses of dizzying crags, giving the impression you’re being transported to a world ever more rugged and remote. But this is an illusion. Lawrence was glad to be in a landscape no longer entirely in thrall to mankind: “I set off up the valley,” he says, “between the close, snow-topped mountains, whose white gleamed above me as I crawled, small as an insect, along the dark, cold valley below.” He could walk on the main road, because there were no cars, just the occasional cart or carriage, and though from time to time “railway sidings and haphazard villas for tourists” irked him, as soon as he was away from them he heard nothing but the roar and splash of the river Reuss, “rustling and rushing and wavering, but never for a second ceasing”. Not so today. “The Gotthard autobahn was completed in 1986,” one of the regular information panels along Swiss National Trail 7 kindly informed me, “making the upper Reuss valley accessible for day trips.” As I read, in fact, the babble of the river mingled with the rumble of heavy vehicles. You despair of getting away from them. Lawrence simply had no idea. You raise your head and start to look for remote paths high up on the mountainside, anything to get away from this interminable motorised willfulness, hammering down from Frankfurt to Milan. And here I saw the chance of injecting some drama into my novel. My trek suddenly became infinitely more dangerous than Lawrence’s, climbing higher and higher, pursued by noise, until on the second day I lost myself in thick raincloud, my phone battery packed up and I was in trouble, stumbling across slippery scree, the path quite lost, saved only at last by the wraithlike appearance of the Maria Hilf Kapelle, a tiny church clinging to a bank of granite. Inside, two boxes of matches and a money box invite me to make a donation and light a candle. To climb the Devil’s Gorge to Andermatt, your path zigzagging above and below a fast road, amid the remnants of abandoned railways, tunnels and bridges, or again to descend the Ticino valley into Italy, constantly looking for ways to escape the autostrada without risking life and limb, is not for everyone.

Or the moment of blistering heat when I was able to strip off and lie naked in the river right beneath the motorway, which, since sound travels upward, seemed strangely silent. Not to mention all the ideas – manna for a writer – that this combination of awesome nature and stubborn human endeavour inevitably inspired.

For historian Filipa Vicente, however, 10 years of combing through the colonial archive at the University of Lisbon proved deeply unsettling; revealing people who were often nameless and were probably photographed without consent. “These are violent visual archives,” said Vicente, a researcher at the university. So last year she began dreaming up a response, inviting Portuguese families of African descent to rummage through their drawers and phones to put together their own photo archive. “For me, it was a need to create a counter-narrative,” said Vicente. “Colonial photography so often is a way of dehumanisation. So I really felt the need to see how photography can be used as a way of self-representation, self-expression, of humanising people.” The result was a collaborative exhibition, on display in Lisbon until the end of November, that teases out the personal stories of a collective history, all while offering up an alternative to the images of one of Europe’s longest-lived colonial empires. Delving into intimate moments that range from pregnancies to wedding parties, each of the photographs in the exhibition were chosen by the families, said Inocência Mata, a professor of literature at the University of Lisbon who co-curated the exhibit with Vicente. “And that’s very important to us, to show that Black people are not only objects, that they are also subjects of their history.” The family photos mostly date back as far as 1975 and reflect the experiences of 35 families who were part of a wave of migration from the country’s former colonies. The family albums are contextualised by photos that reveal the centuries-long history of the city’s African community, which swelled as Portugal launched the transatlantic slave trade in the 15th century. As word of the project spread last year, Chalo Correia knew he had to be part of it. Originally from Angola, Correia’s more than three decades of living in Portugal had laid bare a subtle racism that left him feeling like he would never fully belong. He saw the exhibit as a way to highlight Lisbon’s large and diverse community of African origin – a community deeply rooted in Portuguese history but still seen by many as outsiders. “The photographs seemed a way of making visible what had long been invisible,” he said. Correia, a musician and artist, selected three photos that showed him sitting with two friends on a terrace, a baptism and a family party. Months later, as he wandered through the exhibition’s dozens of family photos, he was overcome with emotion. “I was in tears,” he said. “I felt I understood everyone who was in those photos, even if I didn’t know them.” While the stories are personal, the footprint of Portugal’s empire threads through much of the exhibit, said Vicente. “We had such a late colonialism, such an abnormal and absurd colonialism until 1975,” she added. “And so these stories are very much present in our daily lives.” It’s an echo, in some ways, of a city where monuments and street names continue to reflect the country’s colonial period. “We talk a lot about the legacies of colonialism and Lisbon is full of them,” she said. “But there’s also another aspect of the Portuguese colonial history, which is the existence of this big and important community of African descent.” The exhibition winds through the small rooms within the Padrāo dos Descobrimentos, or monument to the discoveries; the hulking stone and cement structure that was conceived as a means of glorifying and celebrating Portugal’s empire. The location of the exhibition proved controversial, leading some families to decline to participate, said Vicente. She and Mata, however, saw the opportunity to launch a sort of “Trojan horse”, with the exhibition offering a chance to reinterpret one of the city’s many colonial spaces from within. “For us, it’s a way of saying: ‘Yes, this is a historical monument that has this specific story,’” said Vicente. “Inside we are resignifying the meaning of the monument itself by organising this exhibition.” The exhibition comes as Portugal wrestles with the broader question of how best to address its colonial and slave-trading past. Earlier this year, the country’s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, told reporters that Portugal should “pay the costs” for slavery and other colonial-era crimes, a suggestion that was swiftly shot down by the country’s new centre-right coalition government. For Mata, the exhibition’s efforts to shed light on the present-day reality of Portugal’s community of African descent was a potent means of grappling with the past. “These so-called reparations – this is also way of doing it,” she said. “Black people have been part of the construction, they’ve been building this country,” she added. “And is it time that they have their voice.” Family Albums: Photographs of the African Diaspora in Greater Lisbon (1975 to Today) runs in the Padrāo dos Descobrimentos until 30 November 2024"

  Never in danger of prodigy status, these days I skulk on a chess app, slugging it out with other amateur thugs. But as Reeves and Keir Starmer settle into Downing Street, one of the game’s sayings returns to my mind. It’s from the Polish grandmaster and wit Savielly Tartakower, who observed: “The blunders are all on the board, waiting to be made.”
  The blunder is a huge, match-losing error, which only becomes obvious in hindsight. Tartakower is saying that however good either player is, the board will confer a defeat. You can take his point further: loss may not come from that rash exchange, but the foolproof strategy you swore would win. That lesson is one that Labour’s leaders should bear in mind. Starmer and Reeves don’t do surprises. Deliberative as any club player, they make a plan and stick to it for as long as is tenable. That way, they present the tiniest of targets for opponents and the press. Over the previous five years, No 10 served sketch writers and columnists a sumptuous feast: a malfunctioning droid (Theresa May), the blond Nero (Boris Johnson) and ChatGPT Thatcher (you know). Now the pack tails this prime minister from Westminster to Berlin to Paris, eager for slips and scandals. Pickings are so thin that not one, but two of the Mail’s star writers grouse that their man is an “undertaker”. Yet the blunders are all on the board. One theory about the general election is that it was a verdict on the party of wine-time Fridays and gold wallpaper. Britons were sick of being led by donkeys in blue rosettes, runs the story, so they shooed them out. Some around Starmer believe this, and by making this week’s speech in the Downing Street rose garden, the prime minister reminded us that it was the setting for Johnson’s lockdown-busting bacchanalia – of which he was the sober opposite.
  But election polling reliably showed that the public’s biggest worry was the economy. As I wrote at the campaign’s launch, Rishi Sunak’s humiliation was already as good as sealed by two factors. First, the last parliament was, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies judged, the worst for living standards for which there are comparable records. Rocketing fuel bills, soaring food prices, medicine shortages – voters don’t forget such things, and in July they did not forgive. Second, with hospitals and schools at breaking point, the tax burden hit a 70-year high. The electorate is paying more for less. Game over. These are the 10-ton facts of British government after the pandemic, after the banking crash, now the era of free money and cheap energy is over – and on those, Starmer is barely different from Sunak. Labour committed itself to plans that imply spending cuts of about £20bn every year – beyond the £22bn of savings for which Reeves has spent this summer scratching around. This was no oversight, no unforced error: it was core to Starmer’s plan for winning, by robbing critics of their chance to snipe about a “debt bombshell” and the like. A great election strategy, a dire platform for government. The blunders are all on the board. The most important political moment for this winter did not come from Starmer. It wasn’t in a speech, or a treaty. It was the announcement from the energy regulator that gas and electricity prices will go up by 10% from the start of October, taking the average annual bill to more than £1,700. While fuel bills are nowhere near the peak they hit in the winter of 2022-23, they remain far above the levels that we were used to. As Katie Schmuecker of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says, for lower income households, this is “an unrelenting cost of living crisis”. As the country learned last time, higher energy prices blow out nearly everything else, from grocery bills to school budgets. The big difference is that today, there is far less state support. No Tory cost of living payments to people on benefits, worth £900 a year. A much-reduced winter fuel allowance for pensioners. Reeves may well resurrect the household support fund of small handouts for the worst hit, but that is a cocktail umbrella in a gale.
  Cast your mind forward to this winter. The bills are hitting the mat, and taxes are going up. This week, Starmer called these “the big asks … short-term pain for long-term good”. But there have been years of supposedly short-term pain. Over 4m low-income households are already in arrears on at least one bill or debt, while the number of poor households going without food, heating or toiletries hasn’t dipped below 7m in two years. The NHS in England needs an extra £38bn a year to cut backlogs. Seven years after Grenfell prompted all manner of promises about ending the scandal of dodgy cladding, a tower block on the other side of London erupted in flames. After Covid, after double-digit inflation, after austerity, millions of families and whole swaths of our public services are exhausted. This picture is clear in the statistics and from wandering down the dilapidated high streets of much of Britain, including those towns that saw racist pogroms earlier this month. Yet it barely registers in Westminster discourse. Instead, the newspapers truffle out tasty morsels about Morgan McSweeney v Sue Gray – office politics instead of actual politics, debates about desks rather than social housing. Commentators ask for Starmer’s vision, without interrogating his actual promises. Take Labour’s pledge to achieve “the highest sustained growth” of all the G7 richest countries – a feat not in any government’s gift. How would Starmer do that, by locking up Kamala Harris and Emmanuel Macron? The great fight of this parliament won’t be over blueprints or programmes. It will simply be about the degree to which a Labour government is able to show that it can protect its society from a new era of economic instability, while repairing the vast damage done by years of spending cuts and pushing teachers, nurses and other public servants to the very limit.

  Never in danger of prodigy status, these days I skulk on a chess app, slugging it out with other amateur thugs. But as Reeves and Keir Starmer settle into Downing Street, one of the game’s sayings returns to my mind. It’s from the Polish grandmaster and wit Savielly Tartakower, who observed: “The blunders are all on the board, waiting to be made.”
  The blunder is a huge, match-losing error, which only becomes obvious in hindsight. Tartakower is saying that however good either player is, the board will confer a defeat. You can take his point further: loss may not come from that rash exchange, but the foolproof strategy you swore would win. That lesson is one that Labour’s leaders should bear in mind. Starmer and Reeves don’t do surprises. Deliberative as any club player, they make a plan and stick to it for as long as is tenable. That way, they present the tiniest of targets for opponents and the press. Over the previous five years, No 10 served sketch writers and columnists a sumptuous feast: a malfunctioning droid (Theresa May), the blond Nero (Boris Johnson) and ChatGPT Thatcher (you know). Now the pack tails this prime minister from Westminster to Berlin to Paris, eager for slips and scandals. Pickings are so thin that not one, but two of the Mail’s star writers grouse that their man is an “undertaker”. Yet the blunders are all on the board. One theory about the general election is that it was a verdict on the party of wine-time Fridays and gold wallpaper.

But let’s not confuse Germany with the EU,"[{'image_url': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2501c348000896b9513972953955a8b007cea7d3/0_155_5490_3296/master/5490.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'image_alt': 'Keir Starmer and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, shake hands at the end of a joint press conference in Berlin, Germany, 28 August 2024.'}]","Earlier this week, Keir Starmer did a totally standard thing. The newly elected British prime minister made a visit to one of the UK’s biggest neighbours, Germany, which also happens to be a Nato ally. He then went on to France. In a normal world, this in itself would not be considered remarkable – but nothing should be considered normal in the post-Brexit times we live in. During the Brexit negotiations, the relationship between the UK and Germany sank to a very low ebb. Conservative ministers made it clear with their public statements that diplomatic etiquette and basic politeness towards international partners were less of a priority than impressing their domestic tabloid press with anti-European rhetoric. Those days are thankfully behind us, but it still took Starmer’s predecessor, Rishi Sunak, a year and a half to make it to Berlin, an omission that did not go unnoticed among German officials and caused more than a little pique. It is just as easy to underestimate the significance of Starmer’s trip, as it is to overstate it. Admittedly, as a German, I find baffling some of the reactions from the British commentariat. There is, for instance, great excitement that the prime minister has now met the German chancellor five times since Starmer took office barely two months ago. In the weeks after the UK election, Olaf Scholz and Starmer saw each other at the Nato summit, the Euro finals in Berlin and at a gathering of the European political community at Blenheim Palace. One might argue, of course, that cheering on an England team in a major tournament, and attending meetings of international organisations are, again, pretty normal things for a prime minister to do – but never mind. It is all part of the great European “reset”, apparently a project that the Labour government deems a priority. The Conservative opposition is already duly alarmed, warning that Starmer’s visit to Berlin proves his intention to undo what they hold most dear: Brexit. The true believers who still think that leaving the European Union was a marvellous idea really should relax. Their project is safe. It is patently obvious that Starmer’s government has zero intention of “reversing Brexit”, and both the German government and the officials running the EU institutions in Brussels are well aware of that. Starmer has stated repeatedly – before and after the election, as well as during his press conference with Chancellor Scholz – that rejoining the EU is completely off the table, as well as emphasising that there will be no return to free movement. More than that, he also won’t contemplate rejoining the single market or even a customs union with the EU. Those would be steps that would make an actual difference for the British economy, but they would probably require the UK to accept European rules without having a say in making them. Starmer wants a “reset with the EU”, a “closer relationship”; but given his red lines, it remains unclear what that would actually entail, beyond a different tone. There is some room for closer links, but it is limited. Being a “third” country in Brussels is never easy. Building trust and forging new relationships is important, and may pay off in the long run, but it is only the first, small building block of a new relationship. And yet Starmer’s visit to Berlin was a real success. Its significance lies in putting the bilateral relationship with Germany on a new, much closer footing. Both German and British officials have assured me that it was a genuinely productive meeting, which achieved something much more substantial than to merely improve the mood music between our countries. The two governments have issued a joint declaration announcing that they will spend the next six months formulating a bilateral cooperation treaty they hope to sign in early 2025. It is an ambitious plan that extends to every aspect of the bilateral relationship, including working together on law enforcement, energy security, climate change, youth and education, as well as irregular migration. At the heart of the treaty is close cooperation on foreign policy, defence and security. This is a highly desirable goal. Among Europe’s Nato members, the UK and Germany are the largest defence spenders, as well as crucial supporters of Ukraine. Given the current threat level in Europe, and the added uncertainty of what a possible Trump presidency could mean for all of our security, it is imperative for the European members of Nato to work together as closely as possible. That includes the UK, whether or not it is part of the EU, and it is gratifying to see that this message has finally landed in Berlin. A lot of things could still go wrong with this treaty. Starmer’s renewed rejection of a European youth mobility scheme, something the Germans really want, probably did not help proceedings, although he didn’t rule it out entirely. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Four years ago, the Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, who is now running to lead the Conservative party, together with the German CDU parliamentarian Norbert Röttgen, proposed a UK-Germany bilateral treaty. It was the wrong time. The acrimony over Brexit was too fresh and, particularly on the German side, there was widespread concern that the UK could try to use its bilateral relationship with individual European countries to deliberately drive a wedge into the EU. The fact that this is no longer a concern for Berlin shows that trust between our countries has markedly improved. It is important not to confuse a reset in UK-German relations with a Europe-wide one. They are connected, but if Starmer really wants to build a closer relationship with the EU, he needs to go to Brussels, and not just Berlin and Paris. It is safe to say that Brexit won’t be reversed under his government. But the prime minister’s visit to Berlin was a constructive and sorely needed step to move on from it. Making the best of a bad situation is a thankless task. That does not make it unimportant. Helene von Bismarck is a Hamburg-based historian specialising in UK-German relations "

The riots came after a horrific knife attack in Southport – and Tate was among those tweeting, falsely, that the attacker was “an illegal immigrant arrived on a boat one month ago”. This is one example of how misogyny intersects with hard-right ideology, and of how the transmission of extremist ideas has changed, with connections forged between different online audiences. People like Tate may build big followings peddling one sort of outrage, misogyny, and then dabble in others to attract new audiences and cross-pollinate ideas – particularly around big events that offer lots of engagement. The riots demonstrated that the way the hard right organises online is very different now to even seven years ago, when the government last looked at UK counter-extremism strategy. So, it is timely that the new government has commissioned a rapid policy review. Announcing the measure last week the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said it would not only assess the rise of Islamist and hard-right ideologies – the routine focus of counter-extremism strategy – but also other trends, including extreme misogyny. While this grabbed headlines, it’s not actually clear what defining misogyny as extremism will mean in practice. Would expressing misogynist views in and of itself be grounds for a referral to Channel, the government’s secretive deradicalisation programme? Would it get these people on the radar of police? Or would the tipping point be the suggestion of some violent intent? (“Incel” ideology has been linked to violent attacks around the world, including in Plymouth in 2021, when 22-year-old Jake Davison killed five people and himself). Misogyny itself is depressingly widespread, so how will the authorities define the point at which it is “extreme”? Would a police officer who shares photos of a dead woman’s body or uses disparaging language about female colleagues be classed an extremist? What about a judge who decides not to convict a man for sexual assault because of the effect it might have on the man’s life? On LBC, home office minister Jess Phillips was asked about the potential risk to free speech and responded: “You just use the exact same test you would with far-right extremism and Islamism, wouldn’t you? The same test would have to apply.” But looking at the recent history of counter-extremism policy in the UK tells us there is no clear test: in fact, the question of what constitutes an extreme idea, and when it is appropriate for the state to intervene, is hotly contested. When the Preventing Violent Extremism scheme was launched in 2007 in the aftermath of the 2005 London bombings, the emphasis was, as the name suggests, on preventing acts of violence, by fighting “pernicious ideology”. Over the next couple of years, as the strategy was reviewed, the emphasis shifted away from violent extremism to all extremism. While some states view disengagement – whereby a person rejects violent action – as a sufficient goal for deradicalisation work, Britain wants the rejection of extremist ideas themselves. When the Prevent strategy was relaunched again in 2015, the focus on extreme ideas – rather than the risk of violence – was cemented. “For too long, we have been a passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens: as long as you obey the law, we will leave you alone,” David Cameron said in May 2015. This raises an obvious question: should the government be targeting people who obey the law? The consensus then, and in the intervening nine years, has been that it should. In effect, the state has moved beyond prohibiting hate speech and incitement to violence, to trying to distinguish between ideas that can be freely expressed and ideas that cannot. Most people probably agree we don’t want to live in a society where a large number of people hold anti-egalitarian or bigoted views. The problem comes in defining which views are unacceptable and to what degree. In one respect, extremism is defined  by its distance from mainstream opinion, making it difficult to pin down. Even if you accept the premise that government should be fighting – or even criminalising – dangerous or extreme ideas, the central problem remains of how you define those ideas, and how exactly you fight views that are diffuse and widely held. One key criticism of Prevent is that the bar for referral is too low. The 2015 strategy (which is still in place) made it a statutory requirement for teachers, doctors and other public sector employees to report extremism. Numerous human rights organisations have argued that this has led to a chilling effect whereby Muslim students in particular feel less able to express certain views, including criticism of British foreign policy. A 2023 Amnesty report on Prevent, titled This is the Thought Police, said the programme is “stripping people of their basic human rights and hampering their ability to live, work and speak freely”, with referrals often based on little more than a “gut feeling”. It’s far easier for politicians to talk about “countering hateful beliefs” than to stem the underlying causes of these beliefs. In the years since Prevent was introduced, the economy has stagnated, living standards have dramatically dropped, public services have been hollowed out, meaning that many of the community support services that proved helpful in promoting cohesion have been lost. Announcing a new counter-extremism strategy is a cheaper and more immediate way of being seen to “do something”, rather than seeking to solve the structural problems that could be driving people towards these beliefs. Yet it is not a risk-free proposal. Responding to the announcement, charity Women’s Aid said: “If we are to overcome gender-based abuse, past approaches to deradicalisation by previous governments have left us cautious and concerned”, and warned against the issue being “buried within the highly politicised counter-extremism agenda”. If we believe Cooper’s statement that extremism has flourished and grown in recent years, this indicates the current approach is not working. And if that’s the case, then simply adding other forms of ideology won’t do much to solve the problem.

'}]","Just a little over a year since declaring that Covid-19 was no longer a public health emergency of international concern and that the 2022-23 mpox crisis had subsided, the World Health Organization finds itself warning of another crisis as cases of yet another new strain of the mpox virus spread from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to other countries in Africa and beyond. On Thursday the WHO’s director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was in the DRC reviewing the situation on the ground as the organisation issued an emergency appeal to fund a £102m ($135m) mpox global strategic preparedness and response plan to stem transmission. Unfortunately, countries with the resources and power to help stem the outbreak have been slow to offer help. Once again people are dying as vaccines, tests, and treatments that are available in the west, and which could have been assigned long before now to countries at the sharp end, have yet to arrive. The WHO is growing concerned because the virus is mutating into a strain that is spreading across and beyond Africa. Already, 615 people have lost their lives this year in the DRC, where 90% of cases in Africa have been recorded. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, Africa CDC, last week reported 20,000 cases in 13 African countries, almost certainly an underestimate owing to the absence of adequate surveillance. Now the first cases have been registered as far away as Thailand and Sweden. The tragedy is that what could have remained a locally contained outbreak has turned into a killer disease because the countries that have the vaccines have been slow to act, even when they were aware that the 2022 outbreak led to more than 100,000 mpox cases in 121 countries. Today, effective vaccines that could help prevent the disease from spreading are being stockpiled in America and Europe, while countries affected, including the DRC, have yet to receive doses. It is a solvable problem. Of course the engagement of local communities is needed to stop transmission. But international support is also essential. First, thousands of available vaccines could be released now. The Africa CDC estimates that the continent may need as many as 10m doses to end the outbreak – but that may be a worst possible scenario that can be avoided. Currently, Japan has pledged to donate 3m doses of its LC16m8 vaccine, which is also recommended for children. Spain will donate 500,000 vaccines. The European Commission has pledged to donate 215,000 vaccines, while Germany and France have each separately pledged to donate 100,000. Soon, the US will send 50,000 doses to the DRC. The arrival there of the first vaccines is expected within days, and key decisions will need to be made about how best to allocate these precious doses. More will be needed to meet the needs of a country of almost 100 million people. Second, the burden can be shared, and the cost of the two shots of the vaccine people need can be negotiated downwards. While the market price – between $70 and $100 – remains prohibitive for the poorest countries, the global nature of the threat shows why wealthier countries should help. The pandemic, and the work of Covax, the initiative to guarantee access to Covid-19 vaccines, already demonstrate that no one is safe until all are safe, and global coordination in getting vaccines to the right places is imperative. Furthermore, the recent establishment of global mechanisms such as the $500m First Response Fund of Gavi, the vaccine international alliance working to protect children, helps provide low-income countries with resources immediately for vaccine responses to a public health emergency. Third, we must ramp up our manufacturing capacity to ensure more supply. This will require pooled procurement mechanisms backed by financing from donors to coordinate purchasing. The lesson of Covid-19 is that local vaccine manufacturing in Africa must now also play a key role. Western vaccine manufacturers should enter into agreements to transfer manufacturing technology to African manufacturers. But a bigger lesson needs to be learned quickly, for it is now urgent that we fund the investment plans set out by the WHO to make sure it can respond to crises. The mpox outbreak reminds us that communicable diseases are rising to become the leading cause of premature mortality and, for the first time in recent history, the number of children who have not received any vaccine dose is climbing. All this adds to the rising threats to life from conflicts and extreme weather events, which are aggravating air pollution and malnutrition. The WHO needs the resources to act because more than 4 billion people lack access to health services and are so poorly protected that they cannot afford to be sick. Yet today, we offer the WHO just 30 cents per person a year to support its life-saving work. It is time to move from the insanity of the hand-to-mouth approach. That means richer countries pass the begging bowl around only after too many avoidable deaths have occurred. Making long-term financial provision for proper healthcare is the best insurance policy in the world. It should not be seen as a cost but as a critical investment – one that if made through the WHO will yield an impressive return of $35 for every $1 invested. And so we urgently need donor countries to provide the WHO with the flexible and predictable funding necessary to execute its strategy over the next four years. To bridge the difference between assessed contributions of $4bn and the need for $11.1bn of sustainable financing for the four years up to 2028, the WHO needs $7.1bn – $1.5bn of which will go directly to expanding healthcare in low- and middle-income countries. This must now be on the agenda of every major donor country in the run-up to November’s G20, chaired by President Lula of Brazil. The cold war-era eradication of smallpox demonstrated that countries can work together and muster the political will to sustainably support WHO in the non-proliferation of infectious diseases. So, we have to ask: how many more outbreaks of disease can the world allow to happen before we realise that if the WHO did not exist, it would have to be created to deal with the challenges ahead?

He was going to be a gamechanger, his bosses thought; a breath of fresh air, capable of engaging even kids at risk of dropping out. Ed had been trained not only to tailor lessons to each child’s individual needs, but patiently to field all those time-consuming parental questions about everything from teenage mental health to what their little darlings were getting for lunch. Unfortunately, the one thing Ed had in common with many promising new teachers is that he burned out fast. Launched in March, by June he was being unceremoniously relieved of his duties after the tech company paid to develop him for the Los Angeles school district reportedly got into financial difficulties. For Ed wasn’t a teacher but a $6m AI-powered chatbot designed to act as a personalised learning assistant for children, and his brief career offers a timely lesson in how not to transform public services using artificial intelligence. The idea of using technology as a kind of magic bullet enabling the state to do more with less has become increasingly central to Labour’s plans for reviving British public services on what Rachel Reeves suggests will be a painfully tight budget. In a series of back-to-school interventions this week, Keir Starmer promised to “move forward with harnessing the full potential of AI”, while the science secretary, Peter Kyle, argued that automating some routine tasks, such as marking, could free up valuable time for teachers to teach. A recent report from Tony Blair’s eponymous thinktank, which has close links to tech industry donors and is positively evangelical about AI, suggests automating marking and lesson planning could cut teaching workloads by a staggering 25% – roughly the equivalent of the much resented 12 hours’ average unpaid overtime that eats into teachers’ evenings and weekends. But that’s just the beginning, the report’s authors argue: in theory Britain could save an astonishing £40bn a year by getting AI to take over backroom tasks across the public sector. Imagine, they argue, being able to process planning applications or benefit claims at lightning speed, instead of making people wait months to discover their fate. Imagine systems that could cut waiting lists by better managing NHS beds, or reduce pressure on hospitals by predicting who was likely to fall seriously ill before it happened. Some of these dreams are already reality, with a pilot scheme in Somerset that analysed patterns in vulnerable patients’ data succeeding in cutting A&E visits by an impressive 60%. But are parts of this grand vision, much like the ill-fated Ed, just too good to be true? The obvious lesson from Los Angeles is to beware of being sold a pup by a hype-driven, profit-hungry industry still in its infancy. A group of worried headteachers convened by the independent school head (and Downing Street historian) Anthony Seldon last year warned that schools were “bewildered by the very fast rate of change in AI”, and didn’t know whom to trust, concluding: “We have no confidence that the large digital companies will be capable of regulating themselves in the interests of students, staff and schools.” The scheme Kyle unveiled this week, a £4m government-backed project to train AI on approved lesson plans and anonymised pupil assessments, suggests he is well aware of these fears and keen to create tools teachers can have confidence in. But the real political challenge may be persuading a suspicious public to embrace this faceless, futuristic state. Most parents would probably be happy enough to have a six-year-old’s spelling test machine-marked – at least once someone fixes whatever glitch made ChatGPT unable to tell how many “r’s there are in strawberry” – and many primary schools already set maths homework via apps that automatically check answers and record pupils’ progress. But I wouldn’t trust a language bot to analyse a GCSE English essay yet, even if AI’s current alarming tendency to invent facts for no obvious reason can be ironed out. Memories of that lockdown summer when exam boards used an algorithm to award GCSE and A-level grades, provoking a furious backlash from parents, meanwhile suggest the public is far from ready for AI to make potentially life-and-death judgments on someone’s eligibility for asylum, say, or disability benefits. Those eye-catching savings identified by the Tony Blair Institute, meanwhile, are achieved partly by doing away with the need for more than 1m civil service jobs – presumably over the unions’ dead body. Beyond all this, meanwhile, lies a tricky question about the nature and pace of work. The siren promise of new technology is always to take care of the boring stuff, freeing humans up for something more fun – or, as the Tony Blair Institute report puts it: “turning the public sector into a rewarding career of choice for ambitious people working at the cutting edge”. Remove the relaxingly humdrum bits you can do in your sleep, however, and a job may become not just more exciting but also significantly more stressful – as GPs discovered when practice nurses began taking on more routine tasks, leaving doctors dealing with difficult cases back to back and sometimes pleading burnout as a result. It’s true that AI, handled right, has enormous capacity for good. But as Starmer himself keeps saying, there are no easy answers in politics – not even, it turns out, if you ask ChatGPT.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)'}]","Listen to Donald Trump or turn on Fox News and you will hear the constant refrain: Kamala Harris is more “radical” and more “far left” than Bernie Sanders. I know this will shock you, but that’s just not the case. It’s always hard, however, to respond to Trump’s lies because, a day later, his lies become even more preposterous. In any case, as we come together to defeat Trump and elect Vice-President Harris, let me remind you of just one simple fact: despite what the corporate media and political establishment may tell you, the so-called “radical” and “far-left” agenda that the progressive movement is fighting for is enormously popular. Poll after poll shows that our ideas are supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans who have the crazy idea that maybe, just maybe, government should represent the needs of all of us and not just wealthy campaign donors. It’s also important to understand that many of these “radical” ideas are already in place in countries around the world. In other words, what’s “radical and crazy” is not what we are proposing, but just how far behind the United States is compared with other wealthy nations in terms of protecting working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the disabled. Some examples: When we talk about guaranteeing healthcare for all as a human right, we’re talking about the ability of every one of us, regardless of income, to go to a doctor when we’re sick and not go bankrupt when we come out of the hospital. We’re talking about the right to change jobs without fear of losing our healthcare. Does that really sound radical to you? When we talk about our government using its bargaining power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, we’re talking about ending the absurdity of Americans paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Does that really sound radical to you? When we talk about paid family and medical leave, we’re talking about a new mom and dad being able to spend the first few months with their newborn child without rushing back to work the next week, and we’re talking about being able to take care of a loved one who is sick without having to worry about missing a paycheck or losing a job. Does that really sound radical to you? When we talk about strengthening public education and childcare and paying teachers a decent salary, we’re talking about making sure that all of our children, regardless of income, get the quality education they need to prepare themselves for the future. Does that really sound radical to you? When we talk about tuition free college, we’re talking about the right of all Americans to get a higher education without leaving school with crushing debt. We’re talking about the ability of the United States to have the kind of highly educated workforce that we need to compete effectively in a highly competitive global economy. Does that really sound radical to you? When we talk about a “Green New Deal” we’re talking about creating millions of good-paying union jobs that will transform our energy system, protect us from climate change, and create a planet that is habitable for future generations – with less drought, famine, floods, extreme weather disturbances, disease and human suffering. Does that really sound radical to you? When we talk about raising the minimum wage to a living wage we’re talking about ending starvation wages and preventing people from having to work two or three jobs just to make ends meet for their families. Does that really sound radical to you? When we talk about strengthening and expanding social security, we’re talking about making sure all of our seniors can retire and live out their lives with dignity. Does that really sound radical to you? When we talk about expanding Medicare to cover dental, hearing and vision, we’re talking about our seniors being able to chew the food they eat, listen to the sound of their loved ones’ voices, and see the world around them. Does that really sound radical to you? When we talk about passing the Pro Act, we’re talking about giving working people the ability to exercise their constitutional right to organize unions against illegal, corporate opposition. Does that really sound radical to you? When we talk about ending Citizens United and moving toward public funding of elections, we’re talking about the need to protect our democracy and prevent billionaires, and their Super Pacs, from buying elections. Does that really sound radical to you? When we talk about making the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, we are simply saying that it is time we addressed the unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality that currently exists and end a regressive tax system that allows billionaires to have an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers. Does that really sound radical to you? Bottom line: what we are fighting for is not a radical agenda. It is a commonsense agenda that the vast majority of Americans support. But let me tell you what is radical. It’s a Republican party that wants more tax breaks for billionaires, massive cuts to social security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits, letting polluters destroy our planet and allowing drug companies to charge us whatever they want. That is radical. So what are we going to do about it? In the next few months let us work overtime to defeat Trump and see that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are elected. Let’s also do all that we can to support progressive candidates throughout the country – and there are many of them up and down the ballot. And then, the morning after we win, let us accelerate our efforts to educate and organize the American people to implement the agenda that works for them, not just the 1%. Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and chairman of the health, education, labor and pensions committee. He represents the state of Vermont, and is the longest-serving independent in the history of Congress"

(Photo by Jack GUEZ / AFP) (Photo by JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images)""}]","There is a rising, bloody Palestinian death toll in the West Bank after two days of Israeli attacks by helicopters, drones and ground forces. In July, the line between law and politics had been sharply drawn when the UN’s top court – the international court of justice (ICJ) – declared that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, is against international law and should end. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said that this was a “decision of lies”. He knows power flows from the barrel of a gun. Illegal Israeli acts in the occupied territories are hardening, mostly with complete impunity, into political developments. The war in Gaza has become a breaking point for the rules-based international order. That is also true in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Israel argues that it has to take action to protect itself from what it claims are attacks using Iranian-supplied arms. Yet bombing civilians from the skies looks like a way of terrorising a people into submission – and it is increasing. Between 2020 and October 2023, six Palestinians in the area were killed in airstrikes. This week, the UN said that 136 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed in Israeli airstrikes since October 2023 – a sharp increase. These numbers are obviously dwarfed by the 40,000 dead Palestinians in Gaza, with the majority of those identified being elderly people, children or women. One obvious distinction between the two theatres of Israeli military occupation is that in Gaza there has been no re-establishment of Israeli settlements. Nor is there a political consensus in Israel to do so. In the West Bank, things have taken a very different turn. The hope remains that a Palestinian state can be created in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with its capital in East Jerusalem. Yet the day before the historic ICJ opinion, the Israeli parliament voted overwhelmingly to pass a resolution – co-sponsored by parties in Mr Netanyahu’s coalition together with support from his rightwing and centrist opponents – rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state. This may be a reflection of where Israeli society finds itself. But it is self-defeating and shortsighted. It is true that Israel had difficulty evicting 8,000 Jewish settlers from Gaza in 2005. There are now nearly 90 times as many in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Even if wiser heads had prevailed years ago, it still would have been a tough ask: there were about 65 times as many settlers in its eastern occupied territories in 2012 as there were uprooted from Gaza in 2005. But the ICJ’s call for Israel to evacuate all of its settlements and pay reparations to Palestinians for damages caused by the occupation should not be lightly dismissed. Israel can barely recognise the national existence of the Palestinians. But it is an admission that the world should encourage Israel to make. The world’s powers must ask why they seem incapable of finding an agreement to end the current bloodshed. Without a deal, faith in the global institutions risks withering away. The 57-year-old story of the Israeli military occupation is not yet over. Only through diplomacy can the longer-term resolution of this conflict be achieved to enable two peoples to live side by side in peace. Yet as long as international legal principles are not respected, no political accommodation will have permanence. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If the government were to restrict the payment to any pensioner living in a property in council tax bands A, B, C or D, this would effectively means-test the benefit by excluding wealthy pensioners who don’t need it. It is not perfect, but is far better than relying on people claiming pension credit, which is a benefit not fit for purpose. The income and savings limits are extremely low and many pensioners who have never claimed anything during their lives are unlikely to apply for it. Upsetting 12.6 million pensioners so early in the electoral cycle is not a good look. The chancellor should consider this option as soon as possible.Garry BondStoke-on-Trent  The major injustice with the government’s proposal to limit the winter fuel allowance to those on pension credit is that those just above the threshold for the credit end up worse off than those on it. There’s a relatively straightforward change that could address this anomaly: increase the guaranteed minimum level of income by the amount of the fuel allowance (possibly with an uplift to compensate for lost income tax). The allowance would thus become an intrinsic part of pension credit. More people would then become eligible to claim the credit. Admittedly, this would reduce savings for the government and it would need to make up the shortfall from elsewhere. But it would remove the blatant injustice of the current proposal without introducing a whole new level of means-testing.Nicholas MayLondon  Martin Lewis suggests winter fuel payments could be paid to those whose houses are on lower council tax bands. A fairer and more efficient way of ensuring payments continue to more needy people is to use tax codes to claw it back from taxpayers. Those on pension credit (including those who, for whatever reason, have not claimed it) and those on the basic state pension would then all continue to benefit from the payments.Martin WrightOtley, West Yorkshire  “We have to make difficult decisions” runs the mantra. Difficult for whom? It did not take long for the newly elected Labour government to return to the old tried and tested, and failed, ways of the Cameron-Osborne playbook. So much hope prior to the election and, sadly, we appear to be seeing history repeating itself with the poorest and most vulnerable bearing the brunt of so-called “savings”. What happened to the “we are coming after” the tax avoiders, evaders, those who are deluged with funds (can anyone justify a £43m hike in the income of the Windsors?), the annual £3bn promised to Ukraine indefinitely. Just how much are the energy companies’ shareholders due to receive, while the poorest fund the payments? The prime minister and chancellor should go for where the money is: there are many billions waiting in uncollected taxes, outnumbering the miserable £1.4bn saved by the cancellation of the winter fuel allowance and the refusal to lift the two-child benefit cap, throwing thousands more children into poverty. Shame on you both. From a totally disaffected lifelong Labour voter.Mary HardyEaling, London  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The hopefully obvious explanation for this is that the behaviours that lead to suspension in young people are the behaviours that, if continued to adulthood, make it less likely to secure employment. Also, these behaviours in school can often go alongside poor application to learning. I am a senior school leader in a comprehensive and I am clear that the act of suspension is not what causes poor life chances. It is the propensity for not respecting others, not working hard and not being willing to follow reasonable instructions that lead to suspensions and poor life chances. Many young people who are suspended do sort themselves out with help from family and school, and are successful in education and employment. But some unfortunately do not address these issues. Hence the correlation that your article describes. The more useful question is what can be done to support schools and parents in helping these young people make better choices. Schools never want to suspend, but the safety and education of the 90% of students who conduct themselves well must be the priority.Adrian HartleyLondon  Having been a teacher and Ofsted inspector, it seems to me that academy trusts’ claim that taking over schools in disadvantaged areas is the cause of high exclusions needs unpicking (Fifty English secondary schools suspended more than a quarter of pupils after pandemic, 25 August). These trusts are knowingly taking on challenging schools and relying on the easier, and cheaper, option of exclusions to deal with behavioural issues. They should have been developing strategies for inclusion and behaviour approaches, and this should have been part of the vetting process for taking over such schools. All learners could be registered with a “home” school that has the responsibility of commissioning and quality-assuring their learning programmes, either on- or off-site, with pupil outcomes linked to that home school. Leaders of schools or academy trusts could then be seen to use their expertise for the benefit of all learners. Behaviour management by exclusion should be seen as a failing.Kevin BuckleDarlington, County Durham  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

A bit speechless,” she said. “I really wanted redemption for Tokyo. I was never happy with that silver, so to go and get gold in the 200m freestyle was just incredible. I was really happy with it. “It’s been really hard with the concussion and then the last three, four months, really hard with mental health issues.

But there was a broken heart for gold-medal favourite Kadeena Cox, who fell at the first bend in her final. Cox, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis after a stroke in May 2014, was racing in the 500m time trial – two laps of the track against the clock – in the C4-5 category and had been second fastest in the morning’s qualifying races. This meant she would cycle fifth out of six athletes in the afternoon, directly after France’s Marie Patouillet, who was roared around with the fervour of a thousand Tricolores, a giant cardboard model of her head waved from the stands. Assured a medal, Patouillet lofted her bike above her head. But that heady atmosphere dropped to a sudden, dazed silence as Cox struggled out of the blocks, wobbled, failed to pick up speed and slid to the ground before the first bend. As British officials rushed to help, the judges watched a replay to see if there had been a mechanical failure that would allow her a restart. But there would be no second chance and a distraught Cox sobbed in the track centre. It comes on top of six months blighted by injury, the last a calf tear she picked up in training six weeks ago. With terrible timing, Cox had to wait to speak to Channel 4 while the medal ceremony for her race took place behind her. “It was a weird one,” she said. “I didn’t feel comfortable in the gate and then when I started … my right side is my weak side and with a condition like mine riding can’t always be perfect. I think I just overcompensated and couldn’t balance on my weaker side. I was all over the shop. “I’m not great, if I’m honest, but I guess that’s sport. I went down on my knee, which is a little bit sore. I’m just emotionally a bit all over the place.” She is due to return to the velodrome on Sunday to defend the mixed team sprint crown with Jody Cundy and Jaco van Gass – though there will be a mental mountain to climb first. “The boys are going to be counting on me to be able to get out there and deliver a quick lap. So I’m hoping I can get my head back in the game and go out there for them. As I say, it’s been a rough week. I’ve been struggling with my mental health, so I really need to go back and try … to speak to my psych probably, who’s messaged me a million times, and just get my head back in gear because it’s all right letting yourself down but I really don’t want to let the boys down.” Sign up to Olympic and Paralympic briefing Our daily email briefing will help you keep up with all the goings on at the Olympics and Paralympics  after newsletter promotion There was, though, happiness for Schrager, who raced against China’s Wang Xiaomei in the final of the 3,000m C1-3 individual pursuit (12 laps of the track, with two riders starting on opposite sides and the objective of catching their opponent or completing the distance in the fastest time). Both had broken the world record in qualifying, but Wang was dominant in the final, knocking three seconds off her earlier effort. Schrager, at her first Games, grew up on a farm in Wiltshire, where there were no opportunities for a girl with cerebral palsy to jump on a bike. She was a talented sprinter, coming fifth in the T35 100m final at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, but became bored of athletics. She joined the British cycling programme after her A-Levels, was a “Bambi on ice” as she describes herself, but came back for more, the empty roads during the Covid pandemic a blessing. “There’s a whole army behind us to get to this point, it is everyone’s medal,” she said afterwards. A medal presented by a dapper looking Jackie Chan. And there was another medal for Bate, at 47 the oldest British rider, competing at his third Games. Bate, who was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa in 2011, picked up silver in the men’s B individual pursuit alongside pilot Chris Latham. They flew through qualifying but knew that their biggest rivals were Tristan Bangma and Patrick Bos, and the Dutch pair duly took gold in a powerful final performance."

Khudadadi, who competed for Afghanistan at the Tokyo Games in 2021, won bronze in the women’s -47kg category. She defeated Turkey’s Ekinci Nurcihan in what was effectively a bronze medal match after the next scheduled opponent, Morocco’s Naoual Larrif, withdrew. When the final buzzer sounded at the Grand Palais, Khudadadi erupted in joy, throwing her helmet and mouthpiece into the air. “It was a surreal moment, my heart started racing when I realised I had won the bronze,” Khudadadi said, her voice shaking with emotion. “I went through so much to get here,” the 25-year-old added. “This medal is for all the women of Afghanistan and all the refugees of the world. I hope that one day there will be peace in my country.” Khudadadi, who was born without one forearm, began practicing taekwondo in secret at the age of 11 in a hidden gym in her hometown of Herat, in western Afghanistan. Originally blocked from competing following the return to power of the Taliban in 2021, she was later evacuated from Afghanistan after making a desperate appeal on video. Khudadadi was allowed to compete at the Tokyo Olympics for her country following a plea from the international community. After the competition, she settled in Paris and was later offered the opportunity to compete with the Refugee Team at the 2024 Paralympics, being held in her adopted home city. On Thursday, the Grand Palais crowd cheered her on as if she were one of their own. Since fleeing Afghanistan, Khudadadi has been training at Insep, France’s national institute of sport, in Paris with her French coach Haby Niare, who is a former taekwondo world champion. “This medal means everything to me, I will never forget that day,” Khudadadi said. “I won because of the great support I got from the crowd.” “Zakia has been magical. I don’t know how else to put it,” Niare said, beaming with pride. “The training process has been challenging. She faced a lot of injuries and she had to learn a lot in a couple of years but she never lost sight of her goal.” Sign up to Olympic and Paralympic briefing Our daily email briefing will help you keep up with all the goings on at the Olympics and Paralympics  after newsletter promotion Khudadadi received her medal from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, and Andrew Parsons, the president of the International Paralympic Committee. “For the Refugee Paralympic Team, it’s super special, it’s super important,” Parsons said. “Zakia just showed to the world how good she is. It’s an incredible journey, it’s something that we should all learn about.” Before the Games began this week, Khudadadi spoke of her pride at representing refugees. “I am really happy and ready to represent the refugee team because I am a refugee in France,” she said. “I hope we can all get a medal to show how proud we are.” “We need to make people understand that refugees have a right to asylum, that they had to flee their countries because of the situation they were in,” she added. “We need to make people understand the reality of what refugees are going through.”"

Jürgen Klopp, the former Liverpool manager and world’s most famous man-on-a-career-break was there to cheer on his friend Czyz, but also extol the virtues of the Paralympic Games. Czyz is a former professional footballer who sustained an injury at 21 that required his left leg to be amputated at the knee. He is a former Paralympic long jump champion for Germany, a man who sailed around the world on a catamaran while building prosthetics, the owner of an antipodean honey company and now an elite para badminton athlete despite having dedicated himself to the sport only three years ago at the age of 41. “He’s too crazy,” Klopp said of his friend who was beaten 21-5, 21-2 by Bethell. “We are completely different. He’s constantly doing things I’m not brave enough to do. He told me only yesterday how easy it is to dive with sharks and I said: ‘Yeah, I heard it now, I still don’t do it.’ “How was it to watch him? Great, I enjoyed all five points. He’s 44, by the way. I stood next to Elena [Brambilla-Czyz], his incredible wife, and we had tears in our eyes. I know sport is always about the result and winning, but there’s much more behind that story and being here is always so touching that I couldn’t get my head around it.” Three months after stepping down from his all-consuming role at Anfield, Klopp appeared to be back to his jocular best as he sought to make the case not only for Czyz as a role model – “It’s the most inspiring story I’ve ever heard” – but for parasport as mainstream entertainment. “We experienced the Olympics here in Paris and before that the world was in a big, big crisis maybe. For these two and a half weeks we forgot it, because that’s what sport can do and that’s what the Paralympics can do and there’s no difference, there’s absolutely no difference,” he said. “The stories behind athletes are always special, because my friend is super special, but that’s the only difference really. That’s what I love about sport, that it can change the world, sometimes only for moments and sometimes for ever.” Klopp first met Czyz as the younger man began rehabilitation after his injury. Klopp’s Mainz side played Kaiserslautern in a charity match when Czyz played for Kaiserslautern using a prosthetic leg. But an acquaintance became a friendship in 2015, just before Klopp joined Liverpool, when the pair bumped into each other by chance in Lisbon. Czyz had recently retired from athletics after winning seven Paralympic medals, four gold, in long jump and sprinting over three Games. Klopp then turned Czyz on to sailing and Czyz developed Sailing4Handicaps, a programme that would lead to him and Brambilla-Czyz navigating the world on a catamaran, while manufacturing and distributing prosthetic limbs to amputees in developing countries. “Sailing4Handicaps, nobody would have done that,” Klopp said. “Especially with not knowing how to sail.” Klopp argues there should be more support for athletes hoping to sustain a career in parasport and that there should be more money from broadcasters who, he believes, are missing a trick. “We all are ready to watch much more than we show,” he said. “Broadcasting is a business, 100%, I understand that, but I really think we should show much more, because it’s so encouraging, it’s so wonderful.” Sign up to Olympic and Paralympic briefing Our daily email briefing will help you keep up with all the goings on at the Olympics and Paralympics  after newsletter promotion For Czyz, having been handily beaten by the man he believes is favourite for gold in the SL3 classification (for athletes with lower body impairments), the Paris Games are an experience from which to learn and grow. “I gave it all. I tried everything but this guy, he has an answer for every shot,” he said of Bethell, a silver medallist in Tokyo. “You see his daily work for years. He made great progress and you can see the results. “You can be sure that if you give me two, three years with this intensity, I definitely could battle him in a better way. “Jürgen is family. It’s simply incredible he wants to come. But not only for me, Jürgen is here to simply make a statement that the Paralympics and parasport is amazing. “We need people like Jürgen putting the focus on it. We are talking about full professionals dedicating their lives. If we can do something so the next generation will be able to get an easier approach to the sport, it doesn’t matter if it’s badminton, athletics or whatever, we need to provide a better access, a better support. That is what we are here for.” Will Czyz invite his friend back for future matches? “I don’t know,” he said. “He might be a bit of a curse.”"

It is understood a deal for the Ivory Coast international to move to Ligue 1 has been agreed after Lyon’s owner, John Textor, spoke to Zaha this week. The American businessman, who is also the biggest shareholder at Palace but is looking to sell his 45% stake to allow a potential takeover of Everton, is believed to have played a key role in negotiations with Galatasaray. The deal will ensure Lyon pay no loan fee but they will cover the majority of Zaha’s wages, understood to be around £130,000 a week. He has fallen down the pecking order in Turkey despite helping Galatasaray win the league title last season after leaving Selhurst Park in the previous summer. Palace and Leicester held talks with the 31-year-old about a potential return to the Premier League, with the Palace chairman, Steve Parish, saying he would bring Zaha back “in a heartbeat”. But it is understood that any move to an English club would have made Zaha liable to pay income tax in the UK and Turkey and scuppered those moves. Palace, who are expected to confirm the signings of Eddie Nketiah and Maxence Lacroix on deadline day, had also tracked Lyon’s Rayan Cherki. But while Fulham were also interested in the France Under-21 forward, he is set to sign a new three-year contract to stay in Ligue 1 after returning to first-team training on Thursday.

Palace have remained resolute in their valuation of Guéhi, who played in six of England’s seven games at Euro 2024, and Newcastle are ­increasingly pessimistic about their chances of landing their top ­defensive target before the transfer window shuts on Friday night. Talks between the clubs are not over but there is no sign of a compromise being reached on a fee. Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Steve Parish, Palace’s chairman, set out his stall this month by ­saying Newcastle would need to pay “superstar money” to sign Guéhi. ­Newcastle are believed to be unwilling to go above £65m and they have been linked with defenders RB Leipzig’s Mohamed Simakan and Chelsea’s Axel Disasi. The risk for Palace is they are missing out on their last opportunity to cash in on Guéhi, who joined from Chelsea three years ago. The 24-year-old has two years on his contract and does not intend to sign an extension. Palace will not be in as strong a negotiating position next summer and there is a danger they will lose Guéhi on a free. Palace have sold Michael Olise to Bayern Munich this summer and are keen not to lose another key player. They appear likely to hold on to the ­England midfielder Eberechi ­Eze and have generated funds by ­selling the Denmark defender Joachim Andersen to Fulham for about £30m. Palace are poised to replace Andersen by signing Maxence Lacroix from Wolsburg.

He is endeavouring to focus only on the immediate task ahead, ­blocking out all else. In the process, the world No 1 continues to lay the foundations for a title challenge at the US Open. On Thursday, Sinner navigated a turbulent opening set against a tricky young opponent to reach the third round with a 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 win over Alex Michelsen of the United States. Last week, Sinner announced his previously undisclosed case had concluded with an independent tribunal ruling that he bore no fault or negligence for the fact that the banned substance clostebol was detected in two anti-doping tests. A few days later, Sinner’s US Open campaign had started with a minor scare as he trailed the American Mackenzie McDonald before recovering emphatically toprogress. An even greater challenge seemed to await the Italian against Michelsen, a fast-rising 20-year-old. After reaching his third ATP final last week at the Winston Salem Open, the American is now the youngest player inside the top 50 at a career high ranking of No 49. In that final, which he lost to Lorenzo Sonego of Italy, Michelsen smashed a ball into the crowd in anger, striking a spectator. According to the rules and the precedent set by similar incidents, he should have been defaulted. Instead, he was allowed to play on. While such an incident would usually generate more discussion, Sinner’s anti-doping case has overshadowed all minor talking points and controversies. As Michelsen stared down the No 1 player at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the opening set was tense and ­competitive, with the two players trading breaks as they struggled to defend their second serves. But Sinner completely outserved his opponent in the decisive moments, which allowed him to narrowly edge out the opening set. With the first set secured, a far more relaxed Sinner began to step inside the baseline and dominate the exchanges as he ­navigated a ­comfortable win. While he builds momentum on the court, Sinner’s anti-doping case has continued to generate conversation away from it. Despite facing American players in both of his first two matches, he has received a warm reception from the audience. The response from his fellow players has been more mixed, with both support and criticism alike. “I cannot control the players’ reaction, and if I have something to say to someone, I go there privately, because I’m this kind of person,” he said. “But, look, overall, it has been not bad. So I’m happy about that.” Discussions about the case itself have also continued. Sinner’s anti-doping rule violation is a rare example of an athlete being able to contest successfully the automatic provisional suspensions that an athlete receives upon notification of testing positive for a banned substance. His team moved incredibly quickly, contesting the first provisional ban on the same day, 4 April, he received the notification and before it was repealed a day later. For many, it underlines the benefit of having money, clout and a team of professionals around him. In the aftermath of testing positive, some lower-ranked players would probably be scrambling for lawyers and representation and would not be in a position to respond so quickly. After his previous match, Daniil Medvedev noted that what concerned him most about anti-doping was being found positive for a banned substance without knowing the origin. Sinner was able to quickly determine that he had been contaminated by an ointment purchased by his fitness trainer Umberto Ferrara, which is often not the case. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion Medvedev said: “For me the only thing where I’m a little bit, like, ­doping cases make me scared is imagine – so he knew what happened, and good for him, so he managed to defend himself. Imagine whatever tennis player in the top 100 gets an email, and they say: ‘Look, there was cocaine in your blood.’ “You come to them and you say: ‘Well, I never did anything in my life. I don’t know how did it get there.’ When you don’t know, you get suspended. That’s a little bit the tricky part, but that’s how doping rules are.” As he continues to navigate this situation, Sinner continues to win. His win-loss record now stands at a tour-leading 50-5 (91%) and he has won his past six matches, after winning his fifth title of the year in Cincinnati last week. He will face Christopher O’Connell in the third round after the Australian defeated Sinner’s compatriot Mattia Bellucci 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3."

Boulter, the 31st seed, had arrived in her second round match as the heavy favourite against Bouzas Maneiro, a scrappy, resourceful 21-year-old Spaniard ranked No 74. Boulter held a set point at 5-4 on Bouzas Maneiro’s serve but she sprayed a routine forehand long before losing three consecutive games to concede the set. Despite fighting back from 1-5 down in set two, the British player paid for her inconsistency in the decisive moments. Afterwards, Boulter was frustrated about her passive approach to the match and how she failed to step inside the baseline and dominate. “The higher your ranking, the more the other person’s going to have a go at you and you have to kind of almost stamp your authority a little bit and tell yourself that you’re the aggressor. You’re the one that’s going after it, and that’s how I got that number by my name. I could have done that more today.” After her first round match, Boulter had spoken about her hopes of finally piecing together a deep run at a grand slam tournament. While 2024 has been a stellar career year for her, with her second and third WTA titles propelling her into the top 30 for the first time, her results at the grand slam tournaments have been disappointing and she has failed to reach the third round of a major this year. Draper, meanwhile, has continued his excellent form from his quarter-final run in Cincinnati, moving into the third round without dropping a set. The 25th seed has had to work extremely hard for wins at the grand slam tournaments this year, being dragged to five sets in each of his previous grand slam first round matches. This week, however, he has reached the third round without dropping a set. Alcaraz, the third seed, faces Botic van de Zandschulp to set up a meeting with Draper, who won their last match at Queen’s this summer. “Today I think obviously it was three solid sets of tennis,” he said. “I moved well. I was aggressive. I felt like there was times where I was a bit up and down, but that’s just a five-set match for you. Proud of my performances and hopefully I can keep going.” Draper has now reached the third round or better of the US Open three years in a row, a tournament that is clearly becoming one of his best events on the tour. “I love playing here, for sure. I think the courts really suit my game, especially being a lefty,” said Draper. “I think definitely off the serve it takes the ball, you know, with the slice. If someone hits a slice serve, it really moves off the court, so that’s definitely something that I’ve always found. I think it helps my leftiness. Also, the courts are medium pace. I can use my skills but also my power as well. I can hit through players as well.” Later on Thursday, Dan Evans returned to the third round in New York with a clinical 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 win over Mariano Navone of Argentina. Two days earlier, Evans had battled through the longest match in the history of the US Open just to reach the second round, recovering from 0-4 down in the fifth set to defeat the 23rd seed, Karen Khachanov, in five sets after five hours, 35 minutes. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion With a day to recover from such a gruelling encounter, the 34 year-old found his feet after a slow start and performed at a high level to reach the third round in New York for the seventh time. His next opponent will be the No 10 seed, Alex De Minaur. “It was strange” said Evans. “I don’t know why, I felt a bit more extra pressure to win. I didn’t really want to win that match [against Khachanov] and then lose in the next round. It wouldn’t feel right. I really wanted to focus hard, and I did that pretty good.” Elsewhere, the world No 1, Iga Swiatek, continued to find her feet at the US Open as she demolished the qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-0, 6-1. Karolina Pliskova, the 2016 US Open finalist, was forced to retire from her second-round match against Jasmine Paolini, the fifth seed, after just three points, while Elena Rybakina withdrew from the tournament before her match against France’s Jessika Ponchet."

In a TV interview on the eve of the tournament, the Italy forward spoke wistfully of how a knee injury sustained within six months of helping his country win the previous edition had knocked him off course. “After Euro 2020 I had a chance to position myself among the top footballers in the world,” he said. “Instead I tore my cruciate ligament and had a long period of rehabilitation. My objective is to get back among the very best.” It did not happen this summer. Chiesa played well in Italy’s opener, a 2-1 win over Albania, but struggled along with the rest of his teammates as the Azzurri were dominated by Spain. Benched for the final group game, against Croatia, he failed to make a mark after returning to the starting XI for the last-16 loss to Switzerland. Italy’s manager, Luciano Spalletti, had previously described Chiesa as “our Jannik Sinner” – a reference to their compatriot who won his first major and reached the top of the men’s tennis rankings this year. How could such a talent leave a major tournament without a single goal or assist? And why would Juventus discard him so cheaply now, selling to Liverpool for a reported fee of £10m? The answers are layered. Chiesa was entering the final year of his contract as one of Juventus’s highest earners. The club have spent more than €150m on transfer fees this summer, rebuilding their squad to fit the tactical vision of the new manager, Thiago Motta. Something had to give and they made difficult decisions to cash in on the talented youngsters Matías Soulé, Dean Huijsen and Samuel Iling-Junior, too. Still, that is not the whole picture. On the surface, Chiesa looks like a player who could fit well into Motta’s fluid systems, which call for players to constantly swap roles. In four seasons at Juventus he has started everywhere across the attack, lining up as a winger on either side, a No 10, a lone centre-forward and even a wing-back. Despite tension over his contract, Chiesa was included in first-team training when he returned from his post-Euros break. Two weeks ago, he was placed fuori rosa – off the squad – and made to practise separately. Reporting in Turin suggested Motta was unimpressed with the player’s defensive application. Even after more than 100 games for the Bianconeri, uncertainty persists about how well-rounded a player Chiesa is. For all his eye-catching traits: explosive acceleration, power and an ability to strike the ball off either foot, we are yet to see production to match such potential. Great things were expected when Chiesa joined Juventus from Fiorentina in 2020, initially on loan and then permanently for a combined sum of around €45m (£38m). That surname alone was enough to spark the imagination. He is the son of the former Italy striker Enrico Chiesa, who fired Parma to a Uefa Cup in 1999, but Federico’s 10 goals and nine assists in his final season with the Viola were a more tangible cause for excitement. Chiesa’s first season at Juventus was his best, with 14 goals and 10 assists in all competitions (he notched a further one of each for Fiorentina before the transfer). Then came Euro 2020, where he began as a reserve but took Domenico Berardi’s place on the right of Italy’s attack after coming off the bench to score an extra-time goal against Austria. His goal against Spain in the semi-final cemented his reputation as one of Europe’s brightest emerging talents. All that was before the cruciate ligament tear, suffered during a win away to Roma in January 2022. Chiesa was out for eight months and, since returning, has struggled to recapture his form. A series of further, less dramatic, injuries have played their part. So has coaching. Chiesa’s best season with Juventus came under Andrea Pirlo, playing out wide in a team geared to attack. For the past three campaigns Juventus have been led by Massimiliano Allegri, who prefers a low block. The manager’s hyper-cautious approach made life harder for all the forwards, dragging them further from goal and asking them to make things happen on their own. There was a moment at the start of last season when it appeared Chiesa was close to a breakthrough. Allegri moved him into the middle, playing as a No 10 behind Dusan Vlahovic. Chiesa scored four times in Juventus’s first five league games and the manager set him a target of “14 to 16” for the campaign. In the end, he registered nine in the league, combined with a modest three assists. It is easy to draw out unfavourable comparisons. Chiesa, for all Juventus’s defensive focus, averaged 2.3 shots per game. Teun Koopmeiners, who may fill a similar role for the Bianconeri this season after joining from Atalanta, scored 12 goals from 1.6. Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Not all shots are created equal. If Chiesa’s attempts had a notably low average XG score (0.08 per attempt, per the stats website FBref), it is partly because they were often from further out and earned by individual effort rather than coordinated buildup play. It is also true, though, that Chiesa has been criticised through his career for trying to do too much, playing with his eyes down. That offers a possible explanation for why Motta, whose associative football requires players to constantly be conscious of one another’s positions, was not more eager to keep him around. There is no way to separate Chiesa’s performance over the past three seasons from his context: a player who had to recover from one major injury and several smaller ones, working for a manager who did not play to his strengths. Nevertheless, it is fair to ask whether expectations of Chiesa have been artificially raised by his name and a handful of eye-catching moments, rather than a consistent body of work. How many 26-year-old forwards would be named in the same breath as Sinner when they have hit double figures in a single top-flight season? Chiesa seemed faintly embarrassed by the comparison. In an interview from his Fiorentina days, he once remembered his father saying: “You only become a Serie A player when you have made at least 300 appearances”. Chiesa has made 235. It is easy to see the attraction of a fresh start and a chance to step out a little further from his father’s shadow – even if Enrico did score a goal at Anfield, too, at Euro 96. From the club’s perspective, £10m is a low-cost gamble on a player who could still have his best years ahead. Chiesa said before the Euros that “I want to show everyone what I’m made of”. It is up to him, now, to seize this new chance."

Arne Slot’s side were also drawn to host Bayer Leverkusen, managed by their former midfielder Xabi Alonso, in a ceremony that began a fresh but uncertain era for Europe’s flagship club competition. The semi-automated draw pitted Aston Villa, who are returning to the top table after 31 years away, against Bayern Munich in a repeat of the 1982 European Cup final. Villa won that match 1-0; the following year they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Juventus, whom they will also face this time around. Like Bayern, the Italian side will travel to Villa Park in a significant milestone for the hosts’ development under Unai Emery.

For many years they were a team that England were proud of and we want to be again.” These were just a few of the 144 games decided in a manner far removed from previous group stage draws. The competition has dispensed with its previous format of eight four-team groups; for at least the next three seasons 36 clubs will contest eight matches against different opponents, four at home and four away, in a single league table that concludes in January. The top eight will qualify directly for the knockout stages, with those ranked between nine and 24 contesting an extra playoff round. Manchester City, Arsenal and Celtic can reflect on a mixed bag of assignments. City will reprise their own successful final when they host Internazionale, who they defeated in Istanbul last year. There should not be too much to fear about further home games against Club Brugge, Feyenoord and Sparta Prague; trips to Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, Sporting and the tournament debutants Slovan Bratislava may prove more exacting. Arsenal will also face Inter, visiting San Siro for one of their away fixtures. They will also travel to Sporting Lisbon, with further trips to Atalanta and more first-timers in the form of Girona. Mikel Arteta’s side will welcome PSG, Dinamo Zagreb, Monaco and Shakhtar Donetsk to the Emirates. For Celtic, a visit to Villa is the highlight of an octet that will breed genuine hope of progress to at least the playoffs. They will travel to Borussia Dortmund, Atalanta and Dinamo Zagreb, while hosting RB Leipzig, Club Brugge, Slovan Bratislava and Young Boys. In a nod to more old-fashioned methods, a ball for each club was drawn out by Gianluigi Buffon in the hall of Monaco’s Grimaldi Forum before Cristiano Ronaldo pressed a button that instantly brought that team’s fixtures on to the screen. What was lost in dramatic tension became atoned for in sheer volume, which may yet prove an apt descriptor of a format designed almost entirely to provide more matches between the continent’s elite. From a British perspective, most of the romance blossomed in the draws handed to Liverpool and Villa. Liverpool’s appearance at San Siro will be particularly apt almost 20 years after their astonishing defeat of Milan in the 2005 final. Milan got their own back with a 2-1 victory in 2007. Real Madrid’s visit will revive memories of the 2018 final in Kyiv, which the La Liga champions won 3-1 thanks to Gareth Bale’s stunning overhead kick, and the more controversial final four years later in Paris, which was marred by problems for Liverpool fans getting into the stadium. Lille, Bologna and Alonso’s German champions will travel to Anfield, while Liverpool’s away campaign will be completed at RB Leipzig, PSV ­Eindhoven and Girona. Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion For Villa, memories of Peter Withe’s famous winner in Rotterdam will be rife when they walk out to face Bayern in the most eye-catching of several big-ticket home games. Along with Juventus and Celtic, Bologna will have to tackle Villa Park at full volume. RB Leipzig, Club Brugge, Young Boys and Monaco will be their away opponents. Vidagany said facing Bayern would “close the circle” for his club. “For the Villa fans to be represented here after 42 years, even having Bayern Munich in the group is something,” he said. “Now they will have Bayern at Villa Park, it’s huge and we can say we have the opportunity to qualify.” The league phase’s fixtures may have been churned out in rapid-fire fashion but their order, and precise dates, will not be known until Saturday. The first set of matches will take place from 17-19 September."

He’s someone I’m sorely going to miss and who I owe a lot to. He put a lot into my game, into my career and ­without his help I definitely wouldn’t be where I am now.” Root now sits level with Sir Alastair Cook as England’s top century-maker and is only 198 runs away from becoming his country’s top Test run scorer. With seven fifty-plus scores in his past 11 innings, including three hundreds, Root is in rich form. The same cannot be said of his stand-in captain, Ollie Pope, who once again failed when he top-edged a back-of-a-length ball and was caught for one. “It’s so easy to make it something when it isn’t at all,” Root said in response to questions around Pope’s ability to score runs and lead the side simultaneously. “He seems to be in a really good place with it. That’s more of a storyline for [the media] to play around with. For him, it’s business as usual, go out there and play in the manner that has given him so much success.” Root said he was “a little bit twitchy” on 99, where he was stuck for 12 deliveries. “You can’t not hear the crowd,” he said. “There is an ­element of relief when you cross the line.” Relief and love. Root was visibly emotional when paying homage to Thorpe, someone whom he credits with shaping “pretty much all” of his game. “He was involved with the England Lions and before I’d even made a hundred in a first-class game he picked me for a Lions game,” Root said. “We became good friends and I really enjoyed spending a lot of time with him. It was nice to pay a small tribute. He means a lot to me and that was, I guess, a small thank-you.” Meanwhile, MCC dismissed concerns over the level of ticket sales for day four of the game on Sunday. A statement said: “Across the first three days of the Test match against Sri Lanka, we’re delighted that Lord’s will be near to capacity, closely matching the sellout against West Indies in July. The sales throughout the summer of 2024 have been the best outside an Ashes year.

Cricket is littered with players who have struggled to cope with perhaps the two most difficult roles – opening batter and captain – even when they have not been thrust into them unexpectedly and temporarily. That Dan Lawrence and Ollie Pope are flailing – both in the sense they are floundering and that their innings on day one here had them swinging in a wild and uncontrolled way – can be a surprise only to those who believe there are no situations bravado cannot conquer. On Wednesday, Pope, England’s stand-in captain for the Sri Lanka series in the absence of the injured Ben Stokes, said he had asked Joe Root for some tips about coping with the role and what he called “finding a way to compartmentalise”, to avoid letting his ability to focus on his batting become overwhelmed by the competing considerations of captaincy. This became Root’s speciality during his 64 games in charge. “When I was captain batting wasn’t necessarily fun, it was about going out there to have some peace and quiet,” he said. “It was a time to shut off from the rest of the world.” Root might also have told him about how when he resigned in 2022 he said captaincy had “taken the life out of me”. Maybe Pope has also spoken to Paul Collingwood, England’s assistant coach and another member of the dressing room with relevant experience. He resigned as captain of the one-day side in 2008, saying: “It was draining me of the mental energy I needed. I couldn’t shut cricket out of my mind and that took its toll.” The experience of Michael Vaughan, who was unexpectedly handed the captaincy in 2003 when Nasser Hussain quit after the first of five Tests against South Africa, also seems relevant. He struggled with the bat in that series, averaging 17.50. “It’s been pretty tough mentally to take the captaincy on as I did and transform myself from just being a batsman to being a captain and having to look after other aspects of the game as well,” he said. Pope can hardly be blamed for finding this task too taxing. After three innings, he is averaging a shade over four. It would no surprise if the 26-year-old’s head is spinning as much as,well, the ball as it ballooned off his top edge and looped to his opposite number, Dhananjaya de Silva. He had scored one. Perhaps England could cope for a few games with having a top-order batter whose performances are suffering as a result of him taking on an unfamiliar burden. The problem is that they have two of them. Maybe Lawrence has also asked Root for some advice. Root was promoted to open for the 2013 Ashes, a short-lived experiment that lasted only for that series. “Opening the batting is the hardest thing you can ask a batsman to do in Test cricket,” the selector Geoff Miller said at the time. “It is a tough, tough job.” The position of England’s current selectorate seems to be that anyone can do it. Sign up to The Spin Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action after newsletter promotion It appears they are not alone, given Australia have adopted a similar stance since David Warner’s retirement. “Ideally, you’ve got someone who’s had experience opening but I don’t think it’s a blanket rule,” said Pat Cummins, their captain. He cited the example of Usman Khawaja who “wasn’t a specialist opener until it was basically the only spot available in the team and he forced his way in”. Khawaja’s experience led the player to a different conclusion. “I’m telling you by far opening is the hardest and it’s very hard to bring someone in who hasn’t opened,” he said. In their first four matches after Warner’s retirement, Australia opened with Steve Smith, who for most of his career has batted at No 3 or 4 and averages 62.68 in those positions. As opener, and despite scoring an unbeaten 91 in his second game, he is averaging 27.50. Lawrence’s case is a little different, in that he may not be significantly worse as an opener (where after three innings he averages 24.33) than he is anywhere else (11 innings, averaging 29). Given time he may settle, as the injured Zak Crawley did, at the top of the order, but he is unlikely to have the privilege. His dismissal on Thursday was not encouraging, caught behind after nicking a delivery he could only reach because he had gone for a stroll across his stumps as Lahiru Kumara neared the end of his run-up. It may be, given they won the first match in Manchester, that England take this series. But there is certainly an irony that with their captain and an opener struggling England were rescued by a man who has held both positions and decided the best thing to do with them was to give them up."

The question now is whether Mikel Arteta is tempted to throw him in from the start against his former club when they meet on Saturday. Trossard has made only 28 Premier League starts for Arsenal – the same number of times he has been introduced as a substitute – and has managed 14 goals, with Gabriel Martinelli starting both league games on the left side of his attack so far this season. “I know the competition in the team and it pushes everyone to go onto the next level and I’m very happy to have an impact and help the team,” Trossard said after the Villa game last week. Ed Aarons Arsenal v Brighton, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST) Aaron Ramsdale’s £18m arrival can boost the survival hopes of Southampton. Gavin Bazunu’s long-term injury left Alex McCarthy between the sticks but the veteran will now return to his backup role. Saints manager Russell Martin now has the use of a keeper many Arsenal fans would tell you is no worse than David Raya. Ramsdale now has a chance to restore himself in the England reckoning at a club with a tradition of national-team keepers going back to Jack Robinson in 1899, through Peter Shilton, Tim Flowers and Fraser Forster. He is likely to make his Saints debut at Brentford. By kick-off, there might also be some semblance of solution to the Ivan Toney saga that has hung over the west London club. Whatever happens there, Toney will not play. To Thomas Frank’s credit, they have usually forged on admirably without him. John Brewin Brentford v Southampton, Saturday 3pm “We’re trying to be active,” said Sean Dyche, asked about potential new arrivals to help rescue Everton. A grandmaster at affecting being unruffled in the face of adversity, underneath the gruffness, Dyche is one of football’s great optimists, forever willing to take the positives when many of his contemporaries would plunge into the deepest funk. Considering Everton’s eternal state of doom, then perhaps that sunny outlook is the tonic the club needs to keep swigging from. However, this season bears similar signs to the 2020-21 campaign that ended with Burnley’s relegation. With no goals scored so far in the Premier League, Everton look cold and ill-prepared. They can still be difficult. Last season, Everton seized on the slowness of Andoni Iraola’s start in English football, beating Bournemouth 3-0. In March, it look a last-minute Séamus Coleman own-goal for Iraola to be able to celebrate defeating an Everton team without a win since the previous December. JB Everton v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm What to make of Ipswich so far? The honest answer is that there isn’t really a workable sample size yet, with the Tractor Boys’ losing their two opening games to Liverpool and Manchester City – hardly a test of their survival credentials. Wednesday’s Carabao Cup exit at AFC Wimbledon was more alarming, particularly with new signings Jack Clarke, Kalvin Phillips, Dara O’Shea, Ben Johnson and Chiedozie Ogbene starting, but still doesn’t define their start to the season and their chances of staying up. Portman Road will be bouncing at 3pm on Saturday, and even against a buoyant Fulham side, Ipswich will fancy their chances of earning their first Premier League points in more than 22 years. Michael Butler Ipswich v Fulham, Saturday 3pm The season is only two games old (and who isn’t desperate for an international break after the third?) but already, Morgan Rogers looks like one of its breakout stars. Though he showed his promise last term, this season at Aston Villa suggests a young player making a definitive step up. By the looks of things, Rogers has bulked up during the summer – crucially, without compromising his agility – such that West Ham’s midfield struggled to contain him on the opening weekend, before he gave Arsenal’s Declan Rice and Thomas Partey more than they could handle. The best players are those who do not need circumstances in their favour to regularly affect games. Or, in other words, we know how good Rogers is when he’s good; at some point this season, we’ll find out if he is still good even when he’s bad. Daniel Harris Leicester City v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm Chris Wood scored 15 goals (zero penalties) last season for Nottingham Forest. There is no doubt that they would be a Championship side without him, as Forest survived on 32 points, the lowest-ever safety total in the Premier League. In April, Opta crowned Wood the most clinical player in Europe, converting nearly 40% of his chances in 2023-24, which was also by far the best rate since their Premier League records began in 2003-04. Wood has already found the net this campaign, scoring to secure Forest a draw on the opening day. Forest’s talks with Eddie Nketiah broke down over wages, but Nuno Espírito Santo may be better off sticking with the big New Zealand striker. Wood will be keen to prove why against a Wolves side that shipped six to Chelsea last time out. MB Nottingham Forest v Wolves, Saturday 3pm Julen Lopetegui has veered away from ripping everything up at West Ham. The Spaniard has made a few tweaks here and there since replacing David Moyes – his decision to sideline the captain, Kurt Zouma, in central defence is a notable move – but the overall vibe has been evolution rather than revolution. Tomas Soucek, who was a crucial figure for Moyes, is still a regular in midfield and Vladimir Coufal has started West Ham’s opening two games. While Soucek justified Lopetegui’s loyalty by scoring the winner against Palace last weekend, there is a sense that time is running out for his Czech compatriot. Coufal’s place is in serious doubt after the arrival of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who made an eye-catching impact during his Palace cameo. Wan-Bissaka played a key role in Soucek’s goal and it would be a surprise if he is not in the starting line-up against Manchester City on Saturday. The former Manchester United full-back’s pace could be crucial against Jérémy Doku. Wan-Bissaka will remember doing well against the City winger in the FA Cup final last season. Jacob Steinberg West Ham v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm Control has continued to elude Chelsea. They were thrilling in attack during their 6-2 thrashing of Wolves but the defence remains a concern. Enzo Maresca’s new team have conceded four in their first two matches and the Italian will be looking for an improvement when Crystal Palace visit Stamford Bridge. Chaotic defending was one of the reasons that Chelsea moved on from Mauricio Pochettino. They were vulnerable at set-pieces, prone to silly mistakes and often shaky when placed under serious pressure. Maresca is working to iron out the flaws andwill not have liked every aspect of the performance against Wolves. JS Chelsea v Crystal Palace, Sunday 1.30pm An ankle injury dictates that Dominic Solanke will not lead Tottenham’s attack at Newcastle on Sunday. Eddie Howe must wonder what might have happened had he got his wish and been able to sign his former striker from Bournemouth. PSR concerns meant Newcastle could not justify investing £65m on a striker and, instead, mounted a month-long pursuit of Crystal Palace’s England defender Marc Guéhi, St James’ Park executives have displayed a willingness to invest around the £65m on reinforcing Howe’s defence. But what happens if Sweden’s Alexander Isak gets injured? The idea of Isak partnering Solanke would surely have petrified opposition defences. Might it not have been better to recruit a promising young centre-half to understudy – and eventually replace – the still highly effective defender Fabian Schär? The Switzerland international is suspended on Sunday. Which will be the bigger miss: Schär’s ball-playing abilities at the back or Solanke’s capacity to fill Tottenham’s Harry Kane-shaped hole at centre forward? Louise Taylor Newcastle v Tottenham, Sunday 1.30pm Erik ten Hag is already answering questions about his job security at Manchester United. After two Premier League games (the first a victory over Fulham, the second a 2-1 defeat at Brighton) this talk is seriously premature yet there is a fever-state that surrounds the manager and the club. But if Arne Slot’s Liverpool team beat United at Old Trafford on Sunday, Ten Hag can expect more of the same. Two years ago, after losing their first two outings, Liverpool were their third opponent at Old Trafford, too, and United won 2-1. A victory, again, would be priceless, the prospect of which may be enhanced if Manuel Ugarte’s signing from PSG can be sealed in time for him to be involved.

Trossard has made only 28 Premier League starts for Arsenal – the same number of times he has been introduced as a substitute – and has managed 14 goals, with Gabriel Martinelli starting both league games on the left side of his attack so far this season. “I know the competition in the team and it pushes everyone to go onto the next level and I’m very happy to have an impact and help the team,” Trossard said after the Villa game last week. Ed Aarons Arsenal v Brighton, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST) Aaron Ramsdale’s £18m arrival can boost the survival hopes of Southampton. Gavin Bazunu’s long-term injury left Alex McCarthy between the sticks but the veteran will now return to his backup role. Saints manager Russell Martin now has the use of a keeper many Arsenal fans would tell you is no worse than David Raya. Ramsdale now has a chance to restore himself in the England reckoning at a club with a tradition of national-team keepers going back to Jack Robinson in 1899, through Peter Shilton, Tim Flowers and Fraser Forster. He is likely to make his Saints debut at Brentford. By kick-off, there might also be some semblance of solution to the Ivan Toney saga that has hung over the west London club. Whatever happens there, Toney will not play. To Thomas Frank’s credit, they have usually forged on admirably without him. John Brewin Brentford v Southampton, Saturday 3pm “We’re trying to be active,” said Sean Dyche, asked about potential new arrivals to help rescue Everton. A grandmaster at affecting being unruffled in the face of adversity, underneath the gruffness, Dyche is one of football’s great optimists, forever willing to take the positives when many of his contemporaries would plunge into the deepest funk. Considering Everton’s eternal state of doom, then perhaps that sunny outlook is the tonic the club needs to keep swigging from. However, this season bears similar signs to the 2020-21 campaign that ended with Burnley’s relegation. With no goals scored so far in the Premier League, Everton look cold and ill-prepared. They can still be difficult. Last season, Everton seized on the slowness of Andoni Iraola’s start in English football, beating Bournemouth 3-0. In March, it look a last-minute Séamus Coleman own-goal for Iraola to be able to celebrate defeating an Everton team without a win since the previous December. JB Everton v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm What to make of Ipswich so far? The honest answer is that there isn’t really a workable sample size yet, with the Tractor Boys’ losing their two opening games to Liverpool and Manchester City – hardly a test of their survival credentials. Wednesday’s Carabao Cup exit at AFC Wimbledon was more alarming, particularly with new signings Jack Clarke, Kalvin Phillips, Dara O’Shea, Ben Johnson and Chiedozie Ogbene starting, but still doesn’t define their start to the season and their chances of staying up. Portman Road will be bouncing at 3pm on Saturday, and even against a buoyant Fulham side, Ipswich will fancy their chances of earning their first Premier League points in more than 22 years. Michael Butler Ipswich v Fulham, Saturday 3pm The season is only two games old (and who isn’t desperate for an international break after the third?) but already, Morgan Rogers looks like one of its breakout stars. Though he showed his promise last term, this season at Aston Villa suggests a young player making a definitive step up. By the looks of things, Rogers has bulked up during the summer – crucially, without compromising his agility – such that West Ham’s midfield struggled to contain him on the opening weekend, before he gave Arsenal’s Declan Rice and Thomas Partey more than they could handle. The best players are those who do not need circumstances in their favour to regularly affect games. Or, in other words, we know how good Rogers is when he’s good; at some point this season, we’ll find out if he is still good even when he’s bad. Daniel Harris Leicester City v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm Chris Wood scored 15 goals (zero penalties) last season for Nottingham Forest. There is no doubt that they would be a Championship side without him, as Forest survived on 32 points, the lowest-ever safety total in the Premier League. In April, Opta crowned Wood the most clinical player in Europe, converting nearly 40% of his chances in 2023-24, which was also by far the best rate since their Premier League records began in 2003-04. Wood has already found the net this campaign, scoring to secure Forest a draw on the opening day. Forest’s talks with Eddie Nketiah broke down over wages, but Nuno Espírito Santo may be better off sticking with the big New Zealand striker. Wood will be keen to prove why against a Wolves side that shipped six to Chelsea last time out. MB Nottingham Forest v Wolves, Saturday 3pm Julen Lopetegui has veered away from ripping everything up at West Ham. The Spaniard has made a few tweaks here and there since replacing David Moyes – his decision to sideline the captain, Kurt Zouma, in central defence is a notable move – but the overall vibe has been evolution rather than revolution. Tomas Soucek, who was a crucial figure for Moyes, is still a regular in midfield and Vladimir Coufal has started West Ham’s opening two games. While Soucek justified Lopetegui’s loyalty by scoring the winner against Palace last weekend, there is a sense that time is running out for his Czech compatriot. Coufal’s place is in serious doubt after the arrival of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who made an eye-catching impact during his Palace cameo. Wan-Bissaka played a key role in Soucek’s goal and it would be a surprise if he is not in the starting line-up against Manchester City on Saturday. The former Manchester United full-back’s pace could be crucial against Jérémy Doku. Wan-Bissaka will remember doing well against the City winger in the FA Cup final last season. Jacob Steinberg West Ham v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm Control has continued to elude Chelsea. They were thrilling in attack during their 6-2 thrashing of Wolves but the defence remains a concern. Enzo Maresca’s new team have conceded four in their first two matches and the Italian will be looking for an improvement when Crystal Palace visit Stamford Bridge. Chaotic defending was one of the reasons that Chelsea moved on from Mauricio Pochettino. They were vulnerable at set-pieces, prone to silly mistakes and often shaky when placed under serious pressure. Maresca is working to iron out the flaws andwill not have liked every aspect of the performance against Wolves. JS Chelsea v Crystal Palace, Sunday 1.30pm An ankle injury dictates that Dominic Solanke will not lead Tottenham’s attack at Newcastle on Sunday. Eddie Howe must wonder what might have happened had he got his wish and been able to sign his former striker from Bournemouth. PSR concerns meant Newcastle could not justify investing £65m on a striker and, instead, mounted a month-long pursuit of Crystal Palace’s England defender Marc Guéhi, St James’ Park executives have displayed a willingness to invest around the £65m on reinforcing Howe’s defence. But what happens if Sweden’s Alexander Isak gets injured? The idea of Isak partnering Solanke would surely have petrified opposition defences. Might it not have been better to recruit a promising young centre-half to understudy – and eventually replace – the still highly effective defender Fabian Schär? The Switzerland international is suspended on Sunday. Which will be the bigger miss: Schär’s ball-playing abilities at the back or Solanke’s capacity to fill Tottenham’s Harry Kane-shaped hole at centre forward? Louise Taylor Newcastle v Tottenham, Sunday 1.30pm Erik ten Hag is already answering questions about his job security at Manchester United. After two Premier League games (the first a victory over Fulham, the second a 2-1 defeat at Brighton) this talk is seriously premature yet there is a fever-state that surrounds the manager and the club. But if Arne Slot’s Liverpool team beat United at Old Trafford on Sunday, Ten Hag can expect more of the same. Two years ago, after losing their first two outings, Liverpool were their third opponent at Old Trafford, too, and United won 2-1. A victory, again, would be priceless, the prospect of which may be enhanced if Manuel Ugarte’s signing from PSG can be sealed in time for him to be involved.

Here they are, the Fates, the sleek besuited former players, smiling and speaking only in corporate banalities, shaping destiny through the medium of miniature plastic footballs and glass bowls. And there’s the ringmaster, the Italian deputy general secretary of Uefa, Giorgio Marchetti, with his Eurotrivia and unlikely catchphrases, “a very nice draw” and “…according to the established protocols”. His appearance is benign, but then we thought that of his predecessor; could he be plotting a coup to take over world football? Perhaps the Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin’s decision to make himself part of the show, handing out baubles to Gianluigi Buffon and Cristiano Ronaldo, was an effort to head off that potential threat. But after the draw came the actual football, the formality of the wealthiest sides going through – other, that is, than those abysmally run. If there has been any uncertainty in the group stage recently, it has been provided by Manchester United and Barcelona. But at least there was some jeopardy – and that appears to have largely been eliminated under the new format. Rather than 96 games to eliminate 16 teams, there are 144 to eliminate nine. Projections suggest 14-15 points will be needed to finish in the top eight for automatic qualification for the last 16, and eight-nine points to be in the top 24 and secure a playoff spot. Which is to say that after three of their eight games, teams could effectively be through. This is content production pure and simple, games for the sake of games, the sense of football transformed into entertainment product intensified by the game show dynamic of Ronaldo pushing a large football-styled button to a dramatic clang of music. “Cristiano, Brest v Sturm Graz, is that your final answer?” There are, it’s true, some games that sound attractive. There’ll be repeats of four of the past five finals as Real Madrid face Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool, Manchester City play Inter and Bayern face Paris Saint-Germain. City meet PSG in a clash of the UAE and Qatar. There’ll be interest in Bayern v Barcelona, Madrid v Milan, PSG v Atlético, Liverpool v Bayer Leverkusen, Arsenal v PSG and Arsenal v Inter. Liverpool may feel they have the hardest test of the Premier League sides. But the problem is the games feel decontextualised, alienated, deracinated. These are clashes of the biggest, most glamorous sides in the world. If two European champions face each other and all that is at stake is the difference between finishing fourth and fifth in a preliminary league, has the game really happened at all? Nobody can pretend this is the same as a knockout tie. Given how unlikely it is that any of the biggest sides are going to be in any danger of elimination, it’s not even the same as the group stage, for all its flaws. Uefa may speak excitedly of more of the big teams facing each other more often, but if they’re in games that don’t really matter, so what? If anything that is likely to devalue further the currency of clashes between the giants. An excruciating ‘comedy’ sketch insisting the new format is both simple and what people wanted perhaps suggested just how nervous Uefa is about this new direction. Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion As ever, such interest as there is at this stage is likely to be provided by the sides who have only recently hit the heights, leaving them undervalued by the coefficient system.

Villa, on their return to Uefa’s premier competition for the first time since they played as champions 1982-83, could cause problems for Bayern (the team they beat in the 1982 European Cup final), Leipzig and Juventus. Sebastian Hoeness’s side, meanwhile, could be awkward for Madrid, PSG and Atalanta. The order of the games, which won’t be known until Saturday, could make a difference. But come the final two matchdays in January such drama as there is, beyond a handful of bigger sides squabbling over who gets to avoid the playoffs, it is likely to be a scrap between the lower pot 3 and upper pot 4 sides. Whether the struggle of Young Boys, Celtic, Slovan Bratislava and Monaco to avoid elimination is enough to salvage the tournament is debatable. As the draw ceremony was at pains to emphasise, in its 70-year history, the tournament has undergone a series of changes of format. None, though, have done quite so much to dilute the sense of it as a competition, to make it feel like a series of exhibitions. This is increasingly about football less as sport than as business."

Curry’s agent, Jeff Austin with Octagon, confirmed the agreement on Thursday to the Associated Press. ESPN first reported the agreement between Curry and the Warriors. Curry is now guaranteed about $178m for the next three seasons; about $55.8m for this season, about $59.6m for 2025-26 and now about $62.6m - the most the Warriors could offer by league rule – for 2026-27. When that season ends, Curry’s on-court earnings will have reached about $532m, which for now ranks as second-most in NBA history behind only LeBron James’ $580m in player contracts. The 36-year-old Curry is entering his 16th NBA season, all of them with the Warriors. He’s a 10-time All-Star and 10-time All-NBA selection, has been part of four championships with Golden State and is a two-time MVP. This summer, he also played for the US team that won Olympic gold at the Paris Games, including a dazzling fourth-quarter display to help the Americans beat France in the title game. He averaged 26.4 points for the Warriors last season, and has averaged 24.8 points in his regular-season career."

Firouzja totalled 6/9, half a point half a point ahead of the US champion and world No 3, Fabiano Caruana. The world champion, Ding Liren, drew his first six games and lost two of his final three and finished next to last on 3.5/9. The prestigious event, named after the chess benefactor Rex Sinquefield, is one of the game’s three elite super-tournaments, along with Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee in the Netherlands and Norway Chess at Stavanger. Three years ago, Firouzja seemed destined for a quick journey to the absolute world top. He was the youngest ever to reach a 2800 rating, easily qualified for the 2022 Candidates, and was effectively named as Magnus Carlsen’s heir apparent. Then came failures in the 2022 and 2024 Candidates, a quarrel with the Wijk aan Zee organisers, an episode of all-night one-minute ­bullet games in the middle of a major ­tournament, a decision to work on an alternative career in fashion design, and a ­catastrophic drop in the world rankings from second to 16th. Some believed that he had lost the dedication and commitment to succeed at the ­highest level. In the past few months Firouzja has made significant changes to his lifestyle. He appears more relaxed with interviewers and opponents,, has cut back substantially on blitz and bullet games, and has arrived at the board with well prepared openings. His ranking has jumped back up to world No 5. In retrospect, Firouzja’s marathon win against Caruana in round one was pivotal to his victory. The loser pressed for many moves, but missed a drawing chance by 80 Rd5! Caruana got compensation in a later round when he defeated his old rival Ian Nepomniachtchi, whose Dragon Sicilian blunder 18 g5? allowed the winning counter 18…Nxe4! The tournament winner had a let-off when Gukesh Dommaraju, after a strategically impressive game, failed to find 47 Kg2! followed by Rxa6 when White should win with four pawns for the exchange. Firouzja’s most emphatic victory was against the world champion, where he deliberately kept the position ­complex and tense until Ding ­collapsed in time pressure. Firouzja has now beaten Ding four times in their last five meetings, while in the fifth, at Stavanger, he won the ­Armageddon replay after a classical draw. Ding seemed to be playing better at St Louis than in his previous 2024 events, but he ended tied for eighth out of 10, without winning a single game. He had a minus score for the fifth classical tournament in a row, a negative record for any world champion. Ding’s challenger, India’s 18-year-old Gukesh, drew every game, but still showed himself a master of defence and ready for long, stamina testing, encounters. Betting odds for their world title match at Singapore in November-December before St Louis were 5-8 on Gukesh and 11-5 against Ding. Fide’s annual World Rapid and Blitz championships will be staged on Wall Street, New York, on 26-31 December. This is a major development for the popular event, whose last five renewals have all been played in Asia or in Eastern Europe. Magnus Carlsen, Norway’s world No 1, holds the rapid and blitz titles, and is ranked world No 1 in both. Carlsen will defend his crowns against a challenge led by the Nos 2 and 3 Hikaru Nakamura and Caruana, both of the United States. China’s world champion, Ju Wenjun, heads the entry for the women’s events. Traditionally the World Rapid/Blitz has been played over five days, three for 13 rounds of rapid and two for 21 rounds of blitz. Rapid is 15 minutes per player per game, plus a 10 seconds per move increment. Blitz is three minutes per game, plus a two seconds per move increment. Fast chess formats are among the most exciting in the sport, demanding quick and intuitive decisions plus strong and resilient nerves. They are a test both of skill and of mental endurance, making them a favourite for players and spectators. This year there will be a free day in the middle, devoted to Chess Davos, a conference exploring the links between chess and finance. The new schedule has evoked widespread criticism,both from players concerned about scarce and costly accommodation, and from chess media due to the overlap of the final blitz rounds and New Year celebrations. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion Britain’s problem solvers struck gold in Jurmala, Latvia, at the end of July. The team of John Nunn, Jonathan Mestel and David Hodge won the World Solving Championship in the chess equivalent of a photo finish. They were equal on points scored with the holders, Poland, but solved in a shorter time. It was Britain’s first success in this competition since 2007. Since then, Poland have won 13 times, and they were again the heavy favourites. Nunn and Mestel are grandmasters, while Hodge qualified for the team by winning the annual Winton British Solving Championship, whose open entry starter problem was published in this column in June. The key move which solves the starter problem is given below. Nunn’s personal achievement was impressive. The eminent chess author, who has written classics on all aspects of the game from openings to endings, now holds six world or European championships simultaneously. Nunn is already the reigning world and European over-65 senior champion, and won golds three and four with England at the European and world senior team championships. Now he has his fifth and sixth from the individual senior and team world solving titles in Jurmala. Joseph Blackburne, nicknamed “the Black Death”, and one of England’s all-time greatest players, died a century ago on 1 September 1924. At his peak in the 1880s he was world No 3 behind only Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort. He was a great showman in exhibitions against chess clubs, and is remembered for his quip after drinking a simul opponent’s glass of whisky: “He left it en prise so I took it en passant.” Blackburne’s life and career is chronicled and assessed in an excellent biography by Tim Harding. 3935: 1 Nf6!

The prestigious event, named after the chess benefactor Rex Sinquefield, is one of the game’s three elite super-tournaments, along with Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee in the Netherlands and Norway Chess at Stavanger. Three years ago, Firouzja seemed destined for a quick journey to the absolute world top. He was the youngest ever to reach a 2800 rating, easily qualified for the 2022 Candidates, and was effectively named as Magnus Carlsen’s heir apparent. Then came failures in the 2022 and 2024 Candidates, a quarrel with the Wijk aan Zee organisers, an episode of all-night one-minute ­bullet games in the middle of a major ­tournament, a decision to work on an alternative career in fashion design, and a ­catastrophic drop in the world rankings from second to 16th. Some believed that he had lost the dedication and commitment to succeed at the ­highest level. In the past few months Firouzja has made significant changes to his lifestyle. He appears more relaxed with interviewers and opponents,, has cut back substantially on blitz and bullet games, and has arrived at the board with well prepared openings. His ranking has jumped back up to world No 5. In retrospect, Firouzja’s marathon win against Caruana in round one was pivotal to his victory. The loser pressed for many moves, but missed a drawing chance by 80 Rd5! Caruana got compensation in a later round when he defeated his old rival Ian Nepomniachtchi, whose Dragon Sicilian blunder 18 g5? allowed the winning counter 18…Nxe4! The tournament winner had a let-off when Gukesh Dommaraju, after a strategically impressive game, failed to find 47 Kg2! followed by Rxa6 when White should win with four pawns for the exchange. Firouzja’s most emphatic victory was against the world champion, where he deliberately kept the position ­complex and tense until Ding ­collapsed in time pressure. Firouzja has now beaten Ding four times in their last five meetings, while in the fifth, at Stavanger, he won the ­Armageddon replay after a classical draw. Ding seemed to be playing better at St Louis than in his previous 2024 events, but he ended tied for eighth out of 10, without winning a single game. He had a minus score for the fifth classical tournament in a row, a negative record for any world champion. Ding’s challenger, India’s 18-year-old Gukesh, drew every game, but still showed himself a master of defence and ready for long, stamina testing, encounters. Betting odds for their world title match at Singapore in November-December before St Louis were 5-8 on Gukesh and 11-5 against Ding. Fide’s annual World Rapid and Blitz championships will be staged on Wall Street, New York, on 26-31 December. This is a major development for the popular event, whose last five renewals have all been played in Asia or in Eastern Europe. Magnus Carlsen, Norway’s world No 1, holds the rapid and blitz titles, and is ranked world No 1 in both. Carlsen will defend his crowns against a challenge led by the Nos 2 and 3 Hikaru Nakamura and Caruana, both of the United States. China’s world champion, Ju Wenjun, heads the entry for the women’s events. Traditionally the World Rapid/Blitz has been played over five days, three for 13 rounds of rapid and two for 21 rounds of blitz. Rapid is 15 minutes per player per game, plus a 10 seconds per move increment. Blitz is three minutes per game, plus a two seconds per move increment. Fast chess formats are among the most exciting in the sport, demanding quick and intuitive decisions plus strong and resilient nerves. They are a test both of skill and of mental endurance, making them a favourite for players and spectators. This year there will be a free day in the middle, devoted to Chess Davos, a conference exploring the links between chess and finance. The new schedule has evoked widespread criticism,both from players concerned about scarce and costly accommodation, and from chess media due to the overlap of the final blitz rounds and New Year celebrations. Sign up to The Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action after newsletter promotion Britain’s problem solvers struck gold in Jurmala, Latvia, at the end of July. The team of John Nunn, Jonathan Mestel and David Hodge won the World Solving Championship in the chess equivalent of a photo finish. They were equal on points scored with the holders, Poland, but solved in a shorter time. It was Britain’s first success in this competition since 2007. Since then, Poland have won 13 times, and they were again the heavy favourites. Nunn and Mestel are grandmasters, while Hodge qualified for the team by winning the annual Winton British Solving Championship, whose open entry starter problem was published in this column in June. The key move which solves the starter problem is given below. Nunn’s personal achievement was impressive. The eminent chess author, who has written classics on all aspects of the game from openings to endings, now holds six world or European championships simultaneously. Nunn is already the reigning world and European over-65 senior champion, and won golds three and four with England at the European and world senior team championships. Now he has his fifth and sixth from the individual senior and team world solving titles in Jurmala. Joseph Blackburne, nicknamed “the Black Death”, and one of England’s all-time greatest players, died a century ago on 1 September 1924. At his peak in the 1880s he was world No 3 behind only Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort. He was a great showman in exhibitions against chess clubs, and is remembered for his quip after drinking a simul opponent’s glass of whisky: “He left it en prise so I took it en passant.” Blackburne’s life and career is chronicled and assessed in an excellent biography by Tim Harding. 3935: 1 Nf6!

At the time of writing, 24-hour rainfall totals have reached 300-400mm across swaths of Miyazaki, in the Kyushu region. Up to 630mm of rain has been recorded at one site near Shiiba after about 500mm fell since midnight on Thursday. The rainfall in one area over a two-day period was equivalent to 50-55% of the average rainfall in the UK across an entire year. Within an hour, some parts of Japan received 50-80mm of rain. The storm erupted in the north Pacific Ocean last week and propagated north-westwards towards Japan at the weekend, strengthening as it did so. By Monday evening, it had developed into a very strong typhoon with sustained winds in excess of 97mph (156km/h). Shanshan peaked during the early hours of Wednesday with 130mph gusts. Fortunately this was short-lived and the winds eased as the typhoon churned towards the south of Japan, weakening to about 90mph as it made landfall in Kagoshima prefecture at about 8am local time on Thursday. Severe gusts of up to 157mph have been recorded, throwing debris in the air and ripping tiles off roofs. With the worst of the damage done, Shanshan is projected to travel north-east, traversing Japan and reducing in strength as it does so. Forecast models indicate southern parts of the country could face a further 100-200mm of rainfall over the weekend before the storm dissipates, with a risk of life-threatening floods and landslides. Meanwhile, in the UK, storm names for 2024-25 have been released. The season starts in conjunction with meteorological autumn, and 2024 marks the 10th year since the Met Office began naming storms. Storms are named in partnership with Met Éireann, the meteorological service in Ireland, and KNMI, the Dutch national weather service. The Met Office names are a nod to its 170-year history and include James, Lewis and Mavis. The former chief forecaster Capt James Stagg, who produced the weather report that delayed the D-day landings to 6 June, is credited with having written the most important forecast the Met Office has issued. Storms Lewis and Mavis will pay tribute to Lewis Fry Richardson, who established the mathematical techniques required for weather forecasting, and Mavis Hinds, who pioneered the use of computers within meteorology."

Although scientists knew that pollution and warmer water damage life in freshwater they had not realised the combination of the two further hastens the destruction of much aquatic life, especially the diversity of small creatures which fish need for food. Humans, as happened at the Olympic Games, can choose to avoid endangering themselves by not entering polluted water, but fish in the River Seine in Paris have no options. They are gradually being wiped out by the combination of warmer water and pollution. In Britain the privatised water companies and poorly controlled industrial farming companies have been increasingly pouring raw sewage, animal waste and fertilisers into our waterways for decades. There is a public outcry over this and the new government has promised to take action to improve matters but the new research makes clear that the problem is even more severe and urgent than previously thought. Cherished trout and salmon fisheries and the already endangered eel populations require rivers to be clean and cool for their entire length for adults to breed. Many long-established coarse fisheries will also be lost."

The brutal heatwave the US midwest suffered earlier this week has spread to the eastern half of the country, with more than 20 million people under some kind of a heat alert. But meteorologists predict the weather will cool down, particularly on the east coast just in time for the federal holiday when a cold front moves in. Meanwhile, the south-east may see scattered storms. Cities across central US states like Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana, as well as coastal cities in South Carolina and Virginia are experiencing “major” heat, according to National Weather Service (NWS), with heat index values reaching as high as 105F (40C). The NWS says: “This level of heat affects anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration. Impacts likely in some health systems, heat-sensitive industries and infrastructure.” The climate crisis, caused largely by the burning of fossil fuels, forest destruction and methane emissions, means heatwaves are increasing “in frequency, duration, intensity and magnitude”, the World Health Organization says. Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the US. Around 1,220 people in the US are killed by extreme heat annually, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those in engaging in physical activity, such as athletes or outdoor workers, where heat advisories are active, are at risk for exertional heat stroke. Other vulnerable groups include children, the elderly and disabled, people experiencing homelessness, emergency responders and incarcerated people. The American Red Cross urges people experiencing extreme heat to limit outdoor activities and exercise, avoid sugary, caffeinated or alcoholic drinks, and try to stay in a place with reliable air conditioning."

It is hoped the plan will help kickstart global ambitions on cutting emissions and encourage other countries to follow suit. Under the Paris climate agreement countries are obliged to submit more stringent targets on emissions in February, if the world is to have any chance of holding global temperature rises to within 1.5C of preindustrial levels. But Ed Miliband, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, hopes to announce a new target months early, and has the support of Keir Starmer, the prime minister, in trying to propel the UK into a leadership position on the international stage at climate negotiations. Starmer attended the previous summit, Cop28, when he was leader of the opposition and has been invited to Cop29, which will take place in Azerbaijan in November. Activists representing developing countries told the Guardian the global south would welcome UK plans for the early publication of its emissions-cutting plan, known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC). Harjeet Singh, the global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said: “The UK has a critical opportunity to set the bar for climate leadership and equity by announcing a robust NDC well ahead of Cop29. This proactive approach would signal to other developed nations the urgency of abandoning fossil fuel production and committing to a future powered by renewables. “By scaling up domestic investments in clean energy and fulfilling its fair share of climate finance to support developing countries, the UK can play its part in driving a global just transition that leaves no one behind.” Mohamed Adow, the director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “In terms of international leadership and diplomacy, the UK has fallen behind badly under the previous government. Being one of the first countries to outline a robust NDC is exactly the sort of thing we want to see to show the UK is under new management. “It would be good to see the UK including its fossil fuels phase-out commitment within its NDC. That would set the example that climate plans should be channelled through the UN process rather than announced ad hoc but never formally committed to. This would show the way for others to follow.” Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, countries must set out their NDCs containing targets for future emissions cuts on a five-yearly cycle, with a “ratchet” ensuring they are strengthened each time. The UK’s current NDC pledges a 68% cut in emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. Miliband has asked the Climate Change Committee to advise on the UK’s next target, for 2035. The Guardian understands the CCC’s recommendation is likely to be published before the autumn budget in late October. If that does happen, there would be little time before Cop29 to draw up a fully fledged NDC. The UN is hoping for countries to submit NDCs as detailed plans, rather than simple targets, to make their implementation in full more likely. However, the UK could announce a provisional target and then write a detailed NDC for later submission to the UN that would still be “well ahead” of the deadline for NDCs, as pledged in the joint statement with Brazil earlier this month. The Cop29 summit will take place from 11 November, days after the US election, making it difficult for the US administration to plan its impact at the negotiations.

Those difficulties leave a vacancy on the global stage among powerful developed economies. This month, Miliband showed his intent for the UK to work in partnership with the developing world by visiting Brazil, the current president of the G20 and host of next year’s Cop30. He also held a meeting in London last month with the president of Cop29, Mukhtar Babayev of Azerbaijan. Next year, Miliband will co-host a conference in the UK with the International Energy Agency. These efforts stand in stark contrast to the previous government. Under the Conservative prime ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson, the UK played an important role in international climate negotiations, including hosting the successful Cop26 summit in 2021. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak signalled a change in direction, forbidding King Charles from attending Cop27 in 2022 and with Sunak making significant U-turns on climate policy. Sunak made little impact at last year’s Cop28, spending markedly less time there than other world leaders and meeting few of them. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “The energy secretary will be front and centre of climate negotiations and will personally be leading Cop29 negotiations for the UK. In line with the Paris agreement, we have started planning for our next NDC, which will be submitted at least nine to 12 months ahead of Cop30. No decision on exact timing has yet been made.”"

Bosses have told the prime minister he risks causing “real damage” for the economy if the government’s proposals for the biggest overhaul in workers’ rights for a generation are pushed through too quickly. Labour’s workers’ rights overhaul has become one of the biggest battlegrounds between the new government and businesses. In a meeting with business groups and trade unions earlier this month, it is understood that Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, and Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, reassured employers that they would take a staggered approach to introducing the reforms. After meeting the bosses of Britain’s largest employers’ groups on Thursday, Rachel Reeves promised the government would “co-design” its policies with business on shared priorities to boost economic growth. “Under this new government’s leadership, I will lead the most pro-growth, pro-business Treasury in our history – with a laser focus on making working people better off,” said the chancellor. However, Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), warned banning zero-hours contracts should remain a top priority despite heavy lobbying from bosses. “I would challenge any business leader or politician to try and survive on a zero-hours contract not knowing from week to week how much work they will have,” he said. “It’s time to drive up employment standards in this country and to make work pay for everyone. The government’s forthcoming employment rights bill will help create a level playing field – and stop good employers from being undercut by the bad.” According to new polling commissioned by the TUC, the vast majority (84%) of zero-hours workers want regular hours. Many of those on such contracts are also struggling financially due to being underemployed. The survey of 2,458 people aged 16 and over in employment in Britain, carried out by the strategic opinion researcher Peter McLeod, found that 75% of those on zero-hours contracts had experienced difficulty meeting living expenses due to not being offered enough hours. As many as two-thirds of workers on zero-hours contracts seek extra work, according to the survey, while more than half (58%) had their requests for more hours refused by employers. Labour committed in the general election campaign to legislate within the first 100 days in office to strengthen workers’ rights, including a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts, ending fire and rehire practices, and introducing basic employment rights from day one on the job. Other reforms include repealing anti-trade union legislation introduced by the last government, and creating a single enforcement body to ensure employment rights are being upheld. Sources at this month’s meeting between the government, business groups and unions said ministers indicated that banning zero-hours contracts would be among the first elements of the reform package to be introduced. Other more complex changes – such as the creation of a single employment status, to tackle exploitative practices in the gig economy – would take longer. “They are conscious of the cumulative burden, so it makes sense to think about staggering it,” said a business leader who attended the meeting. “There is concern about the timeframe and if you rush and make a wrong turn.” However, employers are pushing for exemptions in the zero-hours ban, including carve-outs for seasonal workers and the ability to keep offering the contracts to staff who want to keep the flexibility they can offer. More than four million people in the UK are employed in low-paid and insecure work, the TUC said, including a million on zero-hours contracts. The unions’ umbrella group published polling in July showing the vast majority (67%) of voters support banning the contracts. Julian Richer, the founder of the Richer Sounds hi-fi chain, who started the Zero-Hours Justice campaign group, said a ban was “well overdue” while some employers abused the system. “It is time to rid the economy of these contracts so that every worker who wants a secure contract can have one. Driving up employment standards is in everyone’s interests,” he said."

The checkups, which will begin on 30 August and can be completed by employees at their workplace, involve recording a range of information via a questionnaire for each patient. The answers are used to determine their risk for various cardiovascular conditions, and will be considered the equivalent of an NHS appointment. They will initially be available in industries including the building, hospitality and transport sectors, while digital health checks at home will be piloted in the local authorities of Norfolk, Medway and Lambeth. Andrew Gwynne, the minister for public health and prevention, said: “We know so many deadly diseases can be avoided if we seek help in enough time. That’s why we’re working to improve access to treatment while also taking steps to address the preventable causes of cardiovascular disease. “This innovative new programme is an important step towards community-focused healthcare and supporting economic productivity through improving health, shifting the focus from treatment to prevention, easing the strain on the NHS and helping people to live well for longer.” More than 16 million people are eligible for an NHS health check, but data shows that only about 40% of those invited complete one. This is especially true for men, who are less likely to get early help but more likely to develop cardiovascular disease at an earlier age than women. The new programme aims to reach more people through their place of work and make it more convenient for them to understand and improve their cardiovascular health. David Hargroves, the NHS national clinical director for stroke, said: “Health checks can save lives. They can prevent people from developing largely preventable diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes and liver disease. “Councils are exploring new ways to boost uptake, targeting individuals or communities at increased risk, and using proactive outreach programmes to get into those communities who are less likely to attend their general practice.

The month-on-month drop is the first since April, reversing monthly increases of between 0.2% and 0.4%, although the price of an average UK house remains at its highest level since October 2022. The annual rate of house price growth rose to 2.4% in August, up from 2.1% in July and 1.5% in June, the fastest rate since December 2022. The previous high of 2.8% came after the former prime minister Liz Truss and the ex-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous mini-budget, which led to a surge in borrowing rates for buyers. “UK house prices fell 0.2% month on month in August, after taking into account seasonal effects, but the annual rate of house price growth continued to edge higher,” said Robert Gardner, the chief economist at Nationwide. “While house price growth and activity remains subdued by historic standards, they nevertheless present a picture of resilience in the context of the higher interest rate environment, and where house prices remain high relative to average earnings – which makes raising a deposit more challenging.” Earlier this month, the mortgage lender Halifax forecast that UK house prices would continue to grow throughout the rest of this year, as mortgage rates begin to drop after the Bank of England’s move to cut interest rates.

Passengers travelling between London and Edinburgh had faced the prospect of months of disruption after LNER drivers earlier this month announced 22 days of industrial action from the start of September until early November. On Thursday, Aslef said drivers had reached a resolution with LNER regarding the breaking of agreements. It posted on X: “Strike action scheduled for weekends between 31 August and 10 November is therefore suspended. We look forward to normal working resuming.” The strikes were called off after meetings between the union and the company. The dispute is separate from the long-running pay row involving drivers across the UK that looks to have been resolved after a new long-term pay offer was made. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, said: “Once again we have demonstrated that, by sitting round the table and negotiating, issues on the railway can be resolved in a way that means better workplace practices for rail workers and a better service for the travelling public. “Aslef will continue to campaign for a fully staffed railway that doesn’t rely on excessive use of driver overtime. We continue to operate in good faith and we are pleased to have finally resolved this longstanding issue with LNER of abuse of our agreements.” The transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: “For too long our railways have been brought to a standstill by industrial disputes with no end in sight. This is a constructive step forward to fixing our railways and getting the country moving. “Our priority is to deliver the vital reforms our broken railways need, but we cannot deliver reform if services aren’t running, and industrial disputes are left unresolved. “It’s very welcome that LNER and Aslef have found a resolution to this dispute at no extra cost to the taxpayer and that will deliver an improved service for passengers.” The news comes as hundreds of passport control staff at Heathrow are to strike over a four-day period from Saturday in a dispute about working conditions. The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union has said that 650 of its Border Force members working in passport control at Heathrow terminals 2, 3, 4 and 5 would strike between 31 August and 3 September, and would then work to rule, with no overtime, until 22 September.

Bryonie Gawith, 29, and her three children – Denisty Birtle, nine, Oscar Birtle, five, and 22-month-old Aubree Birtle – died in the early hours of last Wednesday, after a fire at their home in Bradford. On Thursday, Mohammed Shabir, 44, and Calum Sunderland, 25, both of Keighley, made their first appearance at a crown court. The men are charged with murdering Gawith and the three children, and attempting to murder Antonia Gawith. The prosecutor Matthew Bean told Bradford crown court there was a third person who was “in a coma”. Bean added: “He is, at the moment, very unwell and the expectation is that he may not recover. He may, but at the moment there is a degree of uncertainty. “There is a possibility there will be two further defendants, perhaps three, on different offences but linked.” Shabir and Sunderland appeared on a video link from prison. They were not asked to enter pleas to the charges. The pair were remanded in custody until their next appearance at the same court for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 25 September. Judge Jonathan Rose, the recorder of Bradford, set a provisional trial date of 4 March. Bean said the trial was expected to last between eight and 10 days, but could be longer if there were other defendants or if the third suspect recovered. West Yorkshire police said Sunderland was arrested after inquiries in the area of Keighley, north-west of Bradford, in the early hours of Monday. Shabir was arrested when he attended a police station after 10am on the same day. Police said four other people remained under investigation, including a 39-year-old man who was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder and remains in hospital in a critical condition. Gawith died at the scene and the three children died from their injuries in hospital. In a statement issued via the force last week, the family of the victims said the loss of “our B” and the children, had brought “unimaginable sadness and grief”. Home Farm primary school, where the two oldest children Denisty and Oscar were pupils, said their mother was “always cheerful and positive” and they had been looking forward to Aubree joining them in the future."

Amanda Walton, 52, who was walking her pet chow chow, threw a missile and damaged a car. Her daughter Megan Davison, 24, jumped on the roof of a car. Davison’s boyfriend Jake Wray, 23, stopped cars at a junction demanding: “Are you white? Are you English?” On Thursday, the three defendants made separate, short appearances at Teesside crown court. Wray appeared by video link from HMP Nottingham and pleaded guilty to violent disorder. At a previous hearing prosecutors said he was arrested for stopping vehicles at a road junction and questioning drivers about their ethnicity. Motorists were only allowed to pass his checkpoint if he was satisfied they were white, the court heard. At the previous hearing, the prosecutor Michael Embleton said: “He was heavily involved in the disorder and plays a leading role in my view.” Judge Francis Laird KC said he would deal with Wray, who was subject to a suspended sentence at the time, on 18 September, and remanded him in custody. The judge said: “You have pleaded guilty to violent disorder. I need to know a little more about you and particularly how you have progressed on the current suspended sentence order.
 “Obviously as you were told when that order was imposed you are at risk of having that sentence activated as well as any sentence that is appropriate for this offence of violent disorder.” Wray’s partner, Davison, and her mother, Walton, appeared in the dock where they pleaded guilty to violent disorder. Davison burst into tears as Laird explained she would be remanded in custody until her sentencing hearing.
 The court was told she was the mother of two children, aged five and six, who were being looked after by an aunt. At a previous hearing, video footage was shown of Davison jumping up and down on a car roof while her mother tugged at a wing mirror. The court heard that Walton could be seen hurling a stone towards a property. The pair, both remanded in custody, were told they would be sentenced on 23 September after reports have been prepared. At Manchester crown court, an Oldham grandmother was told she was facing jail after admitting violent disorder outside a hotel housing asylum seekers where her daughter was pushing her grandson in a pushchair. Vanessa Smith, 42, admitted the same offence as her daughter, Nevey Smith, 21, during trouble outside the hotel in Newton Heath, Manchester on 31 July. Nevey Smith earlier this month admitted violent disorder after being caught on camera throwing liquid from a bottle towards police officers who were trying to maintain order. She was also seen to be pushing her one-year-old son around in a stroller during the trouble. Vanessa Smith, who like her daughter has no previous convictions, appeared for sentence but this was adjourned for the preparation of a pre-sentence report. The lawyer Joshua Bowker told the court Smith had caring responsibilities for a daughter, 11, and son, 16, who both had health problems. Judge Patrick Field KC, granted bail for the defendant, but warned her: “The judge who sentences you will have all sentencing options open to him or her. That must include a custodial sentence, so there must be no misunderstanding.”"

The official figures, described by the suicide prevention charity Samaritans as “worse than expected”, showed 6,069 suicides were registered in the two nations in 2023, up from 5,642 in 2022 and the highest rate since 1999. Three-quarters of the deaths were of males, but the female suicide rate reached its highest level since 1994, according to the annual Office for National Statistics figures. “Rates increased across all age groups compared to 2022, especially among those aged 45 to 64 years,” said Vahé Nafilyan, the head of data and analysis for social care and health at the ONS. “Suicide rates either increased or remained unchanged in each of the nine English regions, but the north-west saw the largest rise. Suicide leaves a devastating impact on individuals, families and communities, and we will continue to monitor suicide registrations, to support work to protect vulnerable people at risk.” Jacqui Morrissey, the assistant director of influencing at Samaritans, said: “Based on these figures, over 900 people will have died by suicide in the 55 days since the new government took power but while we immediately heard about plans for more wind turbines, it is suicide prevention that has been left blowing in the wind. The government needs to get its priorities straight because lives depend on it.” Samaritans called on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to “commit to proper investment for suicide prevention with the same ambition that we have seen drive down smoking rates”. Morrissey said: “These figures are the final wake-up call: suicide is preventable but not without real action.” London had the lowest suicide rate of any region in England. The suicide rate for women across England and Wales was 5.7 per 100,000 people. The rate for men was 17.4 per 100,000 but increased to 25.5 for men aged 45 to 49. A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Every suicide is a tragedy and these figures show a clearly worrying trend, which this government is committed to reversing.

Mussie Imnetu, 41, the head chef at the Arts Club in Dubai, was visiting London on a business trip. At about 11.20pm on Monday, Imnetu was attacked at the Dr Power restaurant in Queensway. Omar Wilson, 31, was arrested in Newham in the early hours of Wednesday morning in connection with the attack. On Thursday he was charged with causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent and was remanded to appear at Westminster magistrates court on Friday. The Metropolitan police said customers in the restaurant tried to stop the attack and officers patrolling the carnival were made aware of a man who was unconscious with a head injury. The officers provided emergency first aid until paramedics arrived, the force said. Police said they were keen to piece together Imnetu’s movements from when he left London’s Arts Club on Dover Street at 1pm on Monday to his arrival at the Dr Power restaurant at 10.30pm. A biography of Imnetu on the Arts Club in Dubai’s website describes him as a “well-travelled chef” who hails from Eritrea and grew up in Sweden before working in London and New York. Before becoming head chef at the Dubai branch of the private members’ club, he worked at a number of upmarket restaurants in London including the original Arts Club, Oblix at the Shard and the Savoy Grill. DCI Brian Howie, leading the investigation from the Met’s homicide command, said: “Our focus is on what happened to Mussie. Did you speak with him at the restaurant or do you have any images or videos between these times that could assist the investigation? “The attack happened around 23.20. Customers at the venue tried to help stop the attack. We need to speak with these people and I urge them to contact us. “We are releasing Mussie’s name and two photos of him – one showing him on the day of the attack – in the hope that it triggers someone’s memory and prompts them to come forward.”"

The Terry’s chocolate milk ball will appear on supermarket shelves this autumn with its manufacturers explaining that, after scoring a hit with a mint ball last year, it wanted to move “beyond orange” with a plain milk chocolate product. But fans of the original were not impressed by the sacrilegious move and took to X to share their thoughts. One simply asked “why?”, while another spoke for many questioning “why are they messing with a Terry’s chocolate orange?” The brand, which is owned by the French group Carambar, traces its origins to 1767 with the opening of a shop in York, selling lemon and orange candied peel. In 1823, Joseph Terry joined and started dreaming up new products including chocolate, candied peel and marmalade. The supremacy of its chocolate orange, which made its debut in 1932, was unchallenged for the best part of a century but the logic for new iterations is obvious. Terry’s wants its treats to be eaten all year round, not just in December. Diehard chocolate orange fans will have to make peace with the sister ball as the company has confirmed it is “not just for Christmas” and will be a permanent addition to its range. “Terry’s is an institution so anything we do needs to respect the love that our customers have for it,” said Lorène Decam, senior marketing manager at Terry’s, who added that it was “very careful to balance innovation with the brand’s core”. Decam said its research showed the new product would appeal to “non-Terry’s shoppers”. Last year the mint version sold out well before Christmas so this year its product developers were encouraged to be “even ballsier”, she said.

Robert O’Brien, still one of the key security voices in the Trump circle, said the UK was endangering its future role in the F-35 project as well as facing the risk of US congressional counter-embargos. The F-35 fighter jets are made in part by British arms firms and are used by Israel’s air force as part of its bombing of Gaza. The Labour government has yet to decide whether to suspend licences for arms exports to Israel over concerns that international humanitarian law may have been breached in the war in Gaza. Speaking to the Policy Exchange thinktank, O’Brien also urged the UK government to do everything it could to shut down the international criminal court’s (ICC) investigation of Israel, accusing the body – which is headed by a British prosecutor, Karim Khan – of being highly selective over which leaders it chose to prosecute. It is the first public sign of the scale of potential tensions facing a Labour government if it pursues a human rights-based foreign policy with the US under a Trump administration. O’Brien said if a UK arms embargo was imposed “there is a potential there for a serious rift, whether it is a Harris or Trump administration, between the UK and the US and I would tread very carefully”. He added: “The F-35 is a joint project and it is going to continue to go to Israel no matter what Turkey, the UK or any other country has to do with it. You would hate to see a situation where the UK is no longer a partner in the F-35 project or other advanced platforms because of a very ill-advised arms embargo on Israel. “The consequences of an arms embargo on Israel is something the UK really needs to think about at a time when Russia and China are posing a massive threat to the west.” He added: “A lot of hi-tech on which the UK relies comes directly or indirectly via Israel.” He said the US would not be imposing an arms embargo on Israel, adding any allies that did would risk real danger and may imperil their own supply chains as well the ability to sell arms products in the US, such as from the British firm BAE Systems. An arms embargo would certainly lead to congressional action to put a counter-embargo on any UK sales in the US. O’Brien said: “It is an extraordinarily dangerous policy proposal and has the potential to tear open the special relationship and really hurt the western alliance and Nato.” O’Brien described the ICC as “really an impediment to peace in the region”, condemning the court’s scrutiny of Israeli politicians including the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. “For the ICC to go after Israeli leaders is a joke … The UK should take every step necessary to shut it down,” he said. The UK has so far supported the ICC’s right to seek to prosecute Israeli and Hamas leaders. It has withdrawn its objection to the ICC having any legal status in relation to acts Israel stands accused of in the occupied territories, a move that implicitly accepts the ICC’s right to seek prosecutions. The US has longstanding objections to the ICC, and has imposed US sanctions on its leaders."

Addressing reporters after EU foreign ministers held a video call with Edmundo González, the former diplomat widely believed to have beaten Maduro in the 28 July vote, Borrell announced: “The European Council decided that Maduro has no democratic legitimacy as president.” Maduro has refused to publish detailed election voting tallies supporting his claim to victory – something that has nearly always been done since Venezuela’s electronic voting system was introduced by his mentor, Hugo Chávez, in 2004. “As there are no tallies and there is no verification, and we fear that there will never be any, we cannot accept Maduro’s legitimacy as Venezuela’s president-elect,” Borrell told journalists after an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. “He will remain president de facto,” Borrell said, “but we deny democratic legitimacy based on the results that cannot be verified.” The EU’s stance stopped short of recognising González as president-elect or the official winner of the election. But Borrell said he believed voting data published by Venezuela’s opposition showed the opposition candidate “got strong support … much bigger support than the one got by Maduro”. Tensions continued to rise in Venezuela on Thursday, with González’s main backer, the opposition leader María Corina Machado, claiming she feared González’s home would be raided by security forces in the coming hours. A prominent opposition politician, Biagio Pilieri, and his son were reportedly seized by secret police after leaving an opposition rally on Wednesday afternoon. The previous day one of Machado’s closest confidants, the lawyer and opposition spokesperson Perkins Rocha, was also allegedly taken. “Dad, I love you and I hope we see each other again soon … in a free Venezuela,” Rocha’s son, Santiago, said in a video message to his father, whose whereabouts remains unknown. Pilieri and Rocha are among more than 1,600 people who human rights activists say have been arrested as part of a post-election crackdown designed to extinguish the latest in a series of opposition challenges to Maduro’s 11-year rule. Borrell said the EU called on Maduro’s government to “put an end to the repression and respect the dignity, freedom and rights of the opposition, starting with Edmundo González, María Corina Machado, all opposition members, civil society and journalists”. “Political prisoners have to be freed,” he added. However, many expect the repression to intensify after Maduro made one of his political movement’s most hard-line figures, Diosdado Cabello, interior minister this week. That position gives the 61-year-old former soldier control of the Bolivarian national police force and the national intelligence service, Sebin."

Matthew Newbould on Friday pleaded guilty to stealing the 20kg garden ornament named Garry from a retirement village at St Helena in Melbourne’s north-east on 6 June. The 33-year-old went to the Leith Park village with a friend to buy a chest of drawers when he spotted the gorilla statue perched on tree stumps, the Heidelberg magistrates court was told. Newbould grabbed Garry and placed him on to the back of a ute he had hired from Bunnings before driving away with it. A member of the public saw the gorilla perched in the back of the vehicle and snapped a photo before contacting police. Newbould was arrested on 5 July and a search of his phone revealed text messages to friends, including one that said: “LOL I stole a gorilla, so what?” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email He was also disqualified from driving at the time of the theft, after losing his licence in July 2023. His lawyer, Rebecca Elder, told the court Newbould made a stupid and opportunistic decision to steal Garry and he never had any intention to sell the statue. Newbould also conceded to magistrate Michael Wighton that he had made a poor mistake. “It was very silly,” he told the court. Elder asked for Newbould to be handed a fine or a community work order as they were both within range for the crime. But Wighton said the combination of the theft and unlicensed driving made the offending more serious. He ordered Newbould to undertake a community corrections order assessment on Monday, ahead of a sentencing hearing in September. “Just keep working on staying out of trouble,” Wighton told him. The 33-year-old’s bail was extended to his next court date."

Coming months after he issued a rare royal proclamation for Māori to urgently rally in unity against crown policies, the death of Kiingi Tuheitia landed heavily on the hearts of Māori and many New Zealanders, who credit him for reigniting hope in a tumultuous time for indigenous rights. “The death of Kiingi Tuheitia is a moment of great sadness for followers of Te Kiingitanga, Māoridom and the entire nation,” spokesperson Rahui Papa said on social media. He added the King had been in hospital recovering from heart surgery just days after celebrating the 18th anniversary of his coronation. Flags around New Zealand flew at half-mast and in the small town of Ngāruawāhia – the seat of the Māori king movement – local mourners began to pay their respects as Kiingi Tuheitia’s body arrived in preparation for his five day tangihanga (funeral), expected to be attended by tens of thousands. At his last public appearance, Kiingi Tuheitia urged all New Zealanders to adopt Māori customs and warned against changing the country’s founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi. “Are you listening, Wellington? There is a better way,” he said. Following the election of New Zealand’s right-wing government in late 2023 and the announcement of proposed policies considered by many to be a rollback of Māori rights, Kiingi Tuheitea called a series of nationwide meetings to protest these and proposed changes to the principles of the Treaty. “He has been the beacon of hope for Māori around this country as we sought to unite ourselves in the face of an adversarial government,” said the chair of Waikato-Tainui iwi’s executive arm, Tukoroirangi Morgan. “He was quiet, he was a man of few words but when he spoke it was meaningful, it touched people, disenchanted as we were. It is a hugely despairing day, he’s left a huge vacuum,” Morgan said. Tributes from local and international leaders highlighted his leadership and said Kiingi Tuheitia brought people together around a common goal: improving Māori lives. Prime minister Christopher Luxon, in Tonga for the Pacific Islands Forum, told Radio New Zealand Kiingi Tuheitia had left a “fantastic legacy”. “He had a great sense of humour, and he just had a lightness about him that I think was appreciated … he navigated some challenging times and obviously challenging issues, but he was somebody who tried to pull everyone together – Māori and non-Māori.” King Charles said in a statement he was “profoundly saddened,” saying he had known Kiingi Tuheitia for decades. “He was deeply committed to forging a strong future for Māori and Aotearoa New Zealand founded upon culture, traditions and healing, which he carried out with wisdom and compassion.” Tongan prime minister Hu’akavemeiliku Siaosi Sovaleni told Radio New Zealand he was a “great leader of the Pacific”. In New Zealand, president of the Māori Party John Tamihere said in a statement: “The Kiingitanga, in our people’s darkest moments, gave our people hope.” The Kiingitanga was founded in 1858 as a force to resist colonisation and try to preserve Māori culture and land. It has no legal mandate and while the monarch role is largely ceremonial, it is also considered to be the paramount chief of several tribes and is recognised for this power. The new leader will be appointed by heads of tribes associated with the King Movement on the day of Kiingi Tuheitia’s funeral but before he is buried, according to Radio New Zealand. Described in a Radio New Zealand obituary as “unpretentious,” Kiingi Tuheitia, a former construction worker, ascended to the throne in 2006 with the death of his mother, Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu.He was known as a fierce advocate for Māori wellbeing and rights during his 18-year reign, including working to reduce Māori incarceration rates and towards whale conservation in the Pacific. In January, in a quote often since repeated on social media and on the airwaves he said: “The best protest we can do right now is: be Māori. Be who we are, live our values, speak our reo, care for our mokopuna [grandchildren], our awa (rivers), our maunga (mountains), just be Māori. We need to be united first, and then we decide our future.” With agencies"

Speaking anonymously to 12News, an employee said that a colleague found Prudhomme dead at her cubicle while walking around the building. Upon arrival at the scene, officials pronounced Prudhomme dead at 4.55pm, local outlets report, citing Tempe police. 12News reports that Prudhomme’s cubicle was located on the third floor and away from the main aisle. The employee who spoke to 12News added that multiple people complained of a foul odor but assumed it was due to plumbing problems. Another employee told the outlet: “It’s really heartbreaking and I’m thinking, ‘What if I were just sitting there? No one would check on me?’” The employee went on to add: “To hear she’s been sitting at the desk like that would make me feel sick … and nobody did anything. That’s how she spent her last moments.” Meanwhile, in a statement to 12News, a Wells Fargo spokesperson said: “We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our colleague at our Tempe office. Our thoughts and prayers are with their family and loved ones during this difficult time. Counselors, through our employee assistance consulting service, are available to support our employees. We are fully cooperating with the Tempe police department in their investigation and will direct all further questions to them.” According to police, the initial investigation did not point to any foul play. The Tempe police criminal investigations bureau is currently working alongside the Maricopa county medical examiner to determine Prudhomme’s cause of death."

The overall toll of 16 Palestinians killed in less than two days would make it the deadliest Israeli operation in the West Bank since the 7 October Hamas attack in Israel which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and ignited the Gaza war. The latest fighting came as the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Thursday he had formally asked the bloc’s members to consider imposing sanctions on some Israeli ministers for “hate messages” against Palestinians that he said broke international law. Borrell did not name any of the Israeli ministers to whom he was referring, nor specify which messages he had in mind. But in recent weeks he has publicly criticised Israel’s security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, for statements he described as “sinister” and “an incitement to war crimes”. The second day of the Israeli operation, in which as many as three brigades of troops have been deployed in several major West Bank cities backed by helicopters, drones and armoured personnel carriers, also included raids in the northern city of Jenin and in the Jordan valley. Inside Nur Shams refugee camp near Tulkarm, residents told the Guardian Israeli troops had gone house to house, detaining Palestinian men as they went. Mohammed Aisha, a 42-year-old Nur Shams resident, speaking at a mosque just outside the camp, said: “The soldiers asked us to leave our house at 10am this morning and the Israelis made a big hole through the walls from one house to another. They handcuffed us with plastic strips and we were taken to a military base outside the city.” Aisha described a scene of desolation left by the raid, adding: “All of our male neighbours were taken to the military base. The roads inside the camp were totally destroyed, sewerage pipes, water pipes were destroyed. The streets became hills of rubble, many houses are totally burned, this is not the camp we knew any more.” On the outskirts of Nablus, 14 miles (23km) to the east, residents were told that some roads in and out of the city would be closed on Thursday, and the sound of drones – locally nicknamed “samiras” – could be heard overhead amid fears the operation would also target the city. “People are saying that tonight it will be Nablus’s turn,” one resident called Ghassan said. Fears are rising about the trajectory of the already serious violence in the West Bank, which has been fuelled by the actions of far-right settlers and their supporters in the government of Benjamin Netanyahu. In recent weeks, Israeli defence officials have voiced their concerns that the situation in the West Bank could boil over, turning the territory into a major new front in Israel’s ongoing conflicts, even as the war in Gaza continues and tensions remain high with Hezbollah on the border with Lebanon. Hamas repeated its calls for Palestinians in the West Bank to rise up, calling the raids part of a larger plan to expand the war in Gaza. The militant group urged security forces loyal to the western-backed Palestinian Authority to “join the sacred battle of our people”. The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, has condemned the Israeli raids, but his forces were not expected to get involved. Referring to the latest West Bank assault, Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, said in a post on X overnight: “This is a war in every sense, and we must win it.” He accused Iran of working to destabilise Jordan and establish an eastern front against Israel via arms smuggling networks, as it has done in Gaza and in Lebanon. To address the threat of an eastern front, Katz said Israel would have to use “all necessary means, including, in cases of intense combat, allowing the population to temporarily evacuate from one neighbourhood to another to prevent civilian harm”. Among those killed on Thursday was a local Islamic Jihad commander named as Mohammed Jaber. According to Palestinian reports, troops dressed in civilian clothes entered the mosque where an exchange of fire occurred. Thursday’s fatalities came a day after Palestinian health authorities said at least 12 Palestinians were killed in Wednesday’s operations. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, called on Israel to halt its military operation in the northern West Bank immediately. “Latest developments in the occupied West Bank, including Israel’s launch of large-scale military operations, are deeply concerning,” Guterres wrote on X. Families of Israeli hostages being held in the Gaza Strip protested near the border on Thursday, demanding a deal to secure their release. At one point they made a dash to try to cross into the coastal territory. Carrying photographs and wearing shirts marked with red paint, relatives of some of the 107 hostages still held by militants in Gaza gathered at Nirim kibbutz in southern Israel, about a mile from the border. They began by shouting messages of love and support through a stack of speakers pointed towards the frontier."

The 17-year-old is the second child to die in custody in the state in less than a year. He was found unresponsive in his cell at Banksia Hill youth detention centre on Thursday night, having arrived at the centre on Tuesday morning, reportedly intoxicated. He had been placed in the intensive supervision unit but was considered low risk with regards to his mental health and self-harm risk, authorities told a press conference on Friday. He was moved to the facility’s general units and had been checked on 10 times that day, before being found unresponsive on the 11th check-up, just before 10pm on Thursday. Staff entered his cell and performed CPR but he was unable to be revived. They were wearing radios and body-worn cameras. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The commissioner of corrective services, Brad Royce, said he had reviewed the body camera footage and that he was “satisfied” with the way staff reacted. “I’m satisfied that their actions around what they’re doing and the way they called for support was appropriate.” Royce said the teenager had called out from his cell prior to his death, but that the cries were “innocuous and nothing” and had “no suggestion of harm”. “It was low-level stuff, innocuous. I’d rather not go into it, but it had no impact on this,” he said. The corrective services minister, Paul Papalia, said the teenager had spent time outside his cell, in communal areas, before returning to his cell sometime after 6pm. He said there was no CCTV in his cell because the 17-year-old wasn’t considered to be at high risk of harm. The Western Australian premier, Roger Cook, admitted that a “failure has occurred” but expressed confidence in the state’s youth detention system. “We’ll continue to make sure we do everything we can to improve the lives of people, not only those who work at the facility but those who are at the facility,” he said. “I have more confidence than ever before in terms of the way we are managing our juvenile detention facilities.” Sign up to Breaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Independent Victorian senator Lidia Thorpe said she was “furious” at the situation and that the state government was refusing to take responsibility. “These deaths are entirely avoidable, and the WA and federal governments are responsible,” Thorpe said. “It shows that this premier, like all governments, refuses to take responsibility for the systems they’ve built that are killing our children. We’re already seeing the victim blaming that we have become so used to.” Thorpe said federal action was needed to address what she described as a “national crisis”. The WA government has faced strong criticism over conditions in Banksia Hill – the state’s only youth detention centre – amid ongoing reports of self-harm, suicide attempts and the destruction of cells. It also comes after 16-year-old Cleveland Dodd died in youth detention late last year. The boy was found unresponsive in his cell at the youth detention unit within the Casuarina prison by staff. The incident was suspected to have been an act of self-harm. An ongoing inquest into Dodd’s death has heard extensive evidence of the challenges facing the youth justice system across the state.

A third person in Wisconsin has been hospitalized because of the mosquito-borne illness, the Wisconsin department of health services said Thursday in a release. That state’s cases involve residents of Outagamie, Fond du Lac and Brown counties. In Lake county, Illinois, three people have tested positive for the virus over the past seven days, the Lake county health department and community health center said Thursday in a release. One of the victims experienced symptom onset in mid-August and died shortly thereafter. West Nile virus is commonly spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. While most people don’t experience symptoms, about one in five can develop a fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea or rash, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About one out of 150 infected people develop a serious, sometimes fatal, illness. An average of 18 cases of West Nile virus are reported in Wisconsin each year, and the virus has been detected this year in mosquitoes, animals and healthy blood donors whose blood screened positive for West Nile virus, the state said. West Nile virus was first reported in the US in 1999 in New York. It gradually spread across the country. In 2003, there were nearly 10,000 cases."

Researchers hope the device – which can beam its data to an app over Bluetooth – will offer an affordable and convenient way to capture and immediately analyse breath biomarkers related to respiratory and metabolic processes. They say it has the potential to improve efforts to diagnose conditions such as lung disease early and to monitor conditions and support tailored treatment plans. “Our technology can serve as a general breath analysis platform. We can choose different sensors for a specific condition or a fusion of sensors for a variety of conditions,” said Prof Wei Gao, senior author of the research, from the California Institute of Technology. “For example, the mask we evaluated in this work can simultaneously monitor kidney conditions as well as airway inflammation in COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] and asthma.” In the journal Science, the team report that current methods of analysing patients’ exhaled breath face challenges around condensing the vapour – often requiring ice buckets or refrigeration – while analyses of such samples are typically carried out in a laboratory. By contrast, their mask is fitted with a device, called EBCare, that enables monitoring of biomarkers in a patient’s breath. The researchers said they used a double-pronged approach to condense breath: not only is the EBCare device made from a material that can easily lose heat, but it contains a hydrogel that is cooled by the natural evaporation of water. The condensed breath is directed towards a built-in sensor that can detect the presence and levels of various components in breath, including its alcohol content, pH and levels of ammonium and nitrite. The condensed breath is then directed to the hydrogel, providing a continuous water source for the evaporation process. The researchers reported several tests of the device among healthy volunteers as well as those with conditions such as asthma and COPD. Among their results they found that the mask could track changes in breath alcohol concentration, and hence the dynamics of alcohol metabolism, as well as monitor changes in levels of ammonium associated with eating protein. The latter, they said, offered a noninvasive alternative to blood tests for renal disease management and personalised protein metabolism monitoring. They also found the concentration of nitrite in the breath was higher in groups with airway inflammation, such as those with asthma. “This [mask] can be worn during a person’s daily activities – during the day and at night. It offers continuous, real-time, and at-home personalised health monitoring without the need for clinical visits,” said Gao. The device is also low cost he said: “The reusable electronics part will cost tens of dollars while the disposal part will cost around $1 per device.” Prof Ian Hall, of the University of Nottingham, who was not involved with the work, said the device was a nice piece of engineering, but that further work was needed to show it can be used to diagnose and monitor conditions. Hall added that the device could prove useful in research. “Often in evaluating a new drug, you want to get indications of whether or not your drug is working at an early stage, and many of the endpoints we use take a long time to develop,” he said."

Evans, 49, is acknowledging his neurofibromatosis, mercifully restricted in the pianist’s case to his left foot, but a brake on this fine musician’s life and mobility from birth. Yet despite these sober origins, this vocal-dominated tracklist is even more soulfully and communally spirited than this earthy outfit usually are. Evans thus raises the notion of walking as a symbol of perseverance and pride everywhere in life, and Philadelphia represents for him the legendarily musical place where much of his significant walking has happened. A diverse cast of his home town’s vocal stars participate, including neo-soul singer Bilal, the jazzily swinging Joanna Pascale and rugged blues artist Paul Jost, alongside the band’s A-list of local instrumentalists. The vocal standout, however, is Lisa Fischer, an illustrious singer (for the Stones, Tina Turner, Sting and many others) ducking and diving from unnerving falsettos to resonant low-end whispers on Blues in the Night, and gracefully dancing with guest trumpeter Nicholas Payton on Stevie Wonder’s Overjoyed. On Dislocation Blues, Jost’s lamenting lines roll over pianist Evans’ and organist Jesse Fischer’s crisply swapped blues fills before the band slam in; Payton’s muted trumpet curls around Bilal’s poignant account of All That I Am. Meanwhile the band’s call-and-response exchanges in that song, and Evans’ and alto saxist Todd Bashore’s startling solos on former band-member John Raymond’s dreamily dirgey Hymn, are sublime. Maybe there’s a vocal or two too many here for some jazzers, but they don’t overwhelm the improv and arranging class of this intuitively inventive band. Emmet Cohen’s pandemic video-stream Live from Emmet’s Place put this young New York pianist on the jazz map. On Vibe Provider (Mack Avenue), the sleek and skilful Cohen and a fine hard-boppish lineup engagingly cavort through a set of originals and standards – on which the leader’s carefree vivacity marks him out from the retro throng, making 1950s/60s forms sound fresh. With Golden City (Miel Music), the much-lauded Puerto Rican saxophonist/composer Miguel Zenón continues his cinematic jazz travelogues – visiting the evolution of San Francisco here from the gold rush to the 21st century, with a formidable lineup including saxophonist Tim Berne, pianist Matt Mitchell and drummer/composer Dan Weiss. And Louis Stewart & Jim Hall The Dublin Concert (Livia Records) is a previously unreleased 1982 duo gig with American guitar legend Jim Hall and Ireland’s comparably mercurial Stewart, showcasing enthralling solos and interplay – notably from Stewart on But Beautiful, and Hall on John Lewis’s 2 Degrees East, 3 Degrees West."

Netflix, from Tuesday 3 September “Let’s go and trash their entire camp!” This reality show – in which 16 survival experts are dropped into the Alaskan wilderness, forced to form groups and then compete to be the last team standing – is getting a bit Lord of the Flies in its second season. Sabotage is now on the agenda but, with some participants trying to keep things honest, will good triumph over evil? There’s a share of $1m for the winners but the real intrigue lies in seeing how (and if) these often prickly lone wolves can bond together for the greater good. Netflix, from Wednesday 4 September Sign up to What's On Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday after newsletter promotion There remains something almost miraculous about the balance this drama locates between the deadly serious nature of the work undertaken by the slack and scuzzy occupants of Slough House and the dry, unsentimental tone of the dialogue and performances. Quality control shows no sign of dipping in season four: after a shocking attack in London at Christmas, Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) and co face challenges on multiple fronts – personal backstories open up this time, to striking effect. But the show remains brilliantly slippery – in the world of espionage, nothing is quite as it seems. Another triumph.Apple TV+, from Wednesday 4 September The gruesome true story of Italian surgeon Paolo Macchiarini is the subject of the second season of this medical crime drama. Played here with sinister smoothness by Edgar Ramírez, Macchiarini specialised in transplants and, for a while, seemed a pioneer and a lifesaver. But when journalist Benita Alexander started examining his practices, something horrific emerged: Macchiarini was experimenting on his patients, many of whom were apparently not seriously ill. However, the closer she got to her quarry, the more blurred the line between personal and professional became. 
  Paramount+, from Thursday 5 September This Finnish crime drama counts Stephen King among its admirers and it’s easy to see why – it’s not an entirely original premise, but it is unpredictable and pleasingly sinister. Ville Virtanen is lugubrious detective Kari Sorjonen, who moves his family to a seemingly tranquil town on the border between Finland and Russia. His hopes for a peaceful environment in which to raise a family are dashed as a series of murders hit the area. Much is made of the harsh, beautiful landscape and the claustrophobia of Sorjonen’s close but occasionally fraught family life.Channel 4, from Friday 6 September"

We spend time behind the scenes of this love letter to swinging 60s London A deafening fire alarm is going off. Bolton locals want to know what that dreadful noise is all about. They pause their shopping and start to crowd around the town hall in the rain, only for Gemma Arterton to appear out of the fire exit, fingers in ears, wearing a blond wig under a baker boy hat. “I’m in such a conspicuous costume,” she laughs, head down, wrapping her spectacular blue PVC coat round her. I’m walking next to her, wondering what I did wrong in a previous life for this to happen five minutes into our interview. We’re on location for the filming of the second season of Funny Woman, Sky’s adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel Funny Girl. Although it is mostly set in London, production largely takes place across north-west England. On the other side of the plaza (which is standing in for Trafalgar Square), a nondescript building has been turned into a thriving 60s department store. Vintage cars line the cobbled street. Earlier, a group of women – all in patent heels – were marching for equality, shouting: “What do we want? Equal pay! When do we want it? Yesterday!” The comedy-drama follows Sophie Straw (Arterton), a former Miss Blackpool and stick-of-rock factory worker, who moves to the capital to find fame like her icon, the comic actor Lucille Ball. It’s a love letter to swinging 60s London and the dawn of great British TV comedy, with a first series that saw her find stardom in sitcom Barbara (and Jim) – and all the sexism, classism and creeps that came with it. As she goes it alone in series two with new show Just Barbara, we see all too clearly what a man’s world women like Sophie had to fight hard to be funny in. You could say, and critics have, that it is a grittier version of The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. Back in the building (it was a false alarm!), I quickly learn not to mention the M word to Arterton. “People love to compare things, don’t they?” she grins politely. “But Mrs Maisel is about a wealthy woman with a fancy house; our show is very much about the working class – they have a lot to lose, and there’s a lot more at stake. Even Sophie, when she’s at her height, is only one bad review away from working in the rock factory again.” Perhaps the comparison deserves an eye-roll because Arterton, 38, has working-class roots herself. After growing up in Kent with her welder father and cleaner mother, she got a scholarship to train at Rada. Her screen breakthrough came as head girl Kelly in the St Trinian’s film, which led to a Bond Girl role in Quantum of Solace. But there’s been a clear pull towards powerful working-class stories, particularly in the stage productions Nell Gwynn and Made in Dagenham. She has since said: “If you are born into a class, being that in your soul and your guts, you will never be anything else.” Arterton has also been a leading voice in the #MeToo movement and in campaigning for equal pay. It can’t have been easy: it’s an unsettling realisation that in St Trinian’s she acted opposite Russell Brand as a schoolgirl that his older character lusted after, and she has spoken about an American manager telling her to “stop doing the feminism thing because it’s not doing you any favours”. But that didn’t stop her. Arterton called on female actors to wear black at the 2018 Baftas in solidarity with anti-sexist movement Time’s Up, penned an alternative feminist ending for her Bond Girl, and set up production company Rebel Park in response to the lack of female roles in the industry. Luckily, she says, when I ask if she relates to any of the issues explored in the show, she hasn’t had “any ‘full on’ experiences” like Sophie, but there are “certainly things that I’ve witnessed or heard about”. “Sexism, racism, homophobia … obviously all of those issues exist and we’re still on a journey to parity,” she adds, “but they occur way less.” Arterton wanted to buy the rights to Hornby’s novel as soon as she read it in 2014, but they had already been sold. A few years later, a production company contacted her with a script by screenwriter Morwenna Banks – who is also the voice of Mummy Pig in Peppa Pig – and asked if Rebel Park wanted to co-produce it. It felt serendipitous. “She is quite like me, a working-class actor and – you wouldn’t think it – but I am quite slapstick in real life,” she laughs. The one huge obstacle that Arterton is dealing with right now is something Sophie hasn’t had to worry about: being a working mum. This is her first project since having a baby son with Peaky Blinders actor Rory Keenan in December 2022. “I’m not going to lie: it has been challenging,” she says. “It’s very, very long days on this job. But it’s only short lived and then I’m back to being mummy. I did think: ‘Am I going to be able to work this job and be a mum?’ So I’m pleased I’ve done it now. I just get on with it and don’t sweat the small stuff as much.” There is one problem she wants to raise, though: “We could do better with childcare in this business, having a creche and things like that, because of the hours. But that’s a whole other conversation.” Arterton is pulled away to pick up a placard and join the protesters, and the three men in Sophie’s life sit down for a chat. Matthew Beard and Leo Bill play Sophie’s writing team Bill and Tony, while Arsher Ali takes the role of her director and will-they-won’t-they love interest Dennis. Bill is navigating being gay when it is still illegal, Tony has a baby on the way and Dennis is handling a much-frowned upon divorce – all while trying to make another hit sitcom. We learn that – after admitting their feelings for each other – Sophie and Dennis can’t be together for three years until his separation from his wife is finalised, in order not to tarnish her social reputation, which only makes you root for them even more. The romcom element is a huge part of the story’s charm, says Asher: “Although I didn’t know romcoms were so fun until I did this – I’ve never seen Bridget Jones.” It’s not the only reason fans adore the show. “It’s very warm,” says Beard, “And each character explores an interesting side of that period, from the politics to sexuality. It also shows how exciting television was at that time!” It’s clear they have a hoot filming it, too. “By about 5pm we’re all slightly delirious,” he says, “It’s a really dangerous time. We’ve definitely corpsed and lost our minds before.” Bill adds: “There’s a lot of piss-taking.” No wonder it has attracted some great comedy names to the cast. The first season starred Rupert Everett as Sophie’s dodgy talent agent, and this season sees the arrival of Tim Key, Roisin Conaty and Gemma Whelan. Whelan plays a journalist called Lynda, but she isn’t on set when I visit. I finally talk to her on a video call some months later during a heatwave, while she is wearing funky sunglasses and sitting in her garden. “I’m in a paddling pool situation with the children, so forgive me,” she says before introducing her smiley young son, who is splashing cold water on her feet. She’s a total delight, clearly, and yet she joins the show as its poisonous villain. “She’s out to kill,” Whelan says of Lynda, who tries to get a scoop on the skeletons in Sophie’s closet. “She’s probably one of the only female journalists working on Fleet Street; another woman in a male-dominated industry, just trying to earn her bread and butter. She’ll get a story at any cost.” But the Game of Thrones actor had a lot of fun playing a not-so-nice character: “I spent a whole afternoon filming in Blackpool Tower!” Whelan knows the world of comedy well: she started her career as a standup comic and won at the Funny Women awards in 2010. It was a “calculated move” to get herself an agent and pivot to acting. It paid off well. She captured the hearts of Game of Thrones fans as Yara Greyjoy, then starred in top shows Upstart Crow, The End of the F***ing World, Gentleman Jack and Killing Eve. How has it been navigating both comedy and TV over the last two decades? “It’s a long journey, isn’t it – equality?” she says. “But there’s much more accountability and transparency on every job I go on now: at the National Theatre, there’s a whole day of consent work and on TV there’s a lot of safeguarding. No one can hide in plain sight any more.” Did the experience inspire her to do standup again? “No,” she deadpans. She loved doing her own shows, but is more than happy for other people to lead the writing and directing these days: “It means I’m not responsible for everything.” Whelan says she loved working with Arteron and the rest of the gang – it’s easy to see why. Arterton was so engrossed in filming that she didn’t even watch her other hit series from last year, Culprits (“I’ll watch it when I finish this!”), while Beard describes the production as a place where “chaos is kind of encouraged”, and Bill says: “There’s just joy in being on set, messing about, having fun and making something that isn’t deeply depressing.” You can tell a third season is in their sights – the drama has already continued beyond the book, and Sophie has a long, exciting career ahead. If that happens, at least Bolton locals know to carry some earplugs around with them next time Arterton’s in town. Funny Woman is on Sky Max on 6 September, and is streaming on Binge in Australia"

But it’s not without its charms, among them the seven-minute, two-part title track: too opaque and ambitious to release as a single, perhaps, but with a dark power to its churning synth backing. Co-written by Kanye West, among others – the 70s soul-influenced intro could have slotted perfectly on to The College Dropout – Tell Your Friends is a ballad that ruminates on fame in equivocal terms: it’s intriguingly unclear whether the lyrics are boastful or jaded, a litany of success’s spoils or a comment on said spoils’ meaninglessness. The lead single from Dawn FM, Take My Breath is fantastic: euphoric disco-house with a synth riff that recalls Daft Punk’s Da Funk, lent an iciness by the lead vocal. But it’s best heard on the album: the segue into it from the wracked How Do I Make You Love Me? is, well, breath-taking. It says something about how smooth and successful the Weeknd’s collaboration with Daft Punk was that Starboy was written in 30 minutes, based on a beat that was on Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo’s phone: the result – mid-tempo, sleek but sad – went on to sell a staggering 11m copies in the US. On any other album – or rather an album that didn’t also feature Blinding Lights – Save Your Tears would be the unequivocal smash hit: a fabulous retooling of clipped synthpop with a killer melody, that smartly digs deep into the ineffable melancholy that lurks around a lot of 80s anthems. A triple-platinum single that eventually occasioned a plagiarism lawsuit from a duo called Epikker – their case, which alleged all kinds of shady dealings, was settled out of court. But forget the legal drama and listen to the actual song: it’s a powerful, emotive ballad with a monochrome spookiness to the production that hits hard, whoever wrote it. Another multimillion seller from Starboy, and as close to straightforward R&B as that album got, Reminder faced down critics who claimed the Weeknd was going too pop – “I’m like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice” – and co-opted a succession of huge hip-hop names as cameos in its video to underline the point. An early sign of Tesfaye’s enduring interest in the 80s – it’s built around a sample from Siouxsie and the Banshees’ Happy House, while the lyrics leaned into that track’s suggestion that happiness is seldom what it seems: as the song progresses, it’s increasingly clear the party it depicts is darkly out of control. Falsetto vocals and a fantastic, slowly building production, courtesy of Metro Boomin, frame the apparently saga of a lost weekend in Vegas, and indeed of the Weeknd lost in Vegas: intended as Tesfaye’s farewell to a hedonistic era of his life, it all ends in grief in the back of a police car. A lengthy two-part track that embodies the sleazy persona debuted on Tesfaye’s initial trio of mixtapes: coercive, manipulative, damaged, drugged-out. The skill lies in surrounding the lyrics with music that somehow makes a total creep seem oddly irresistible: an appealingly spacey, disjointed production based on a sample from indie band Beach House. Given the persona he projected, Tesfaye was perhaps a natural choice for the soundtrack of glossy S&M-themed movie Fifty Shades of Grey. Nevertheless, he really pulled out the stops on Earned It – the dramatic 60s pop ballad strings were an unexpected departure, his vocal heartfelt and powerful. The opening track on his debut mixtape, and thus the world’s introduction to the Weeknd, is an immediately striking entrance: the music offers murkily disturbing electronics, the lyrics attempt to talk an apparently unwilling partner into either taking drugs or having sex or both. It’s incredibly bleak, disturbing and unforgettable. Its title swiped from Bret Easton Ellis’s debut novel – a marathon of coked-out ennui – Less than Zero was the Dawn FM track that most obviously recalled After Hours’ obsession with 80s synthpop. It’s a brilliant piece of songwriting: maddeningly catchy, richly melodic, far more downcast than its snappy rhythm suggests. The highlight of the Weeknd’s second mixtape, The Birds, Pt 1 throws a clattering military drumbeat against moody synths and feedback-drenched guitar, made all the more unsettling for being kept low in the mix. The lyrics warn off a besotted girl: the acoustic coda speaks of genuine self-loathing and desperation rather than you-can’t-handle-me grandstanding. Pop super producer Max Martin earned his keep here: Can’t Feel My Face propelled the Weeknd from acclaimed R&B star to pop sensation, loading a song that anyone could work out was a metaphorical paean to cocaine with so many exuberant hooks that its subject ceased to matter. Another collaboration with Daft Punk, I Feel It Coming channels the spirit of Off the Wall-era Michael Jackson over a slowed-down take on the super-smooth disco sound the French duo had pursued, and offered the listener the unusual sound of the Weeknd being straightforwardly romantic: deservedly a huge hit. After Hours begins in trademark Weeknd style: echoing guitar, falsetto vocals, creepy electronic atmospherics. But it gradually gathers pace over six minutes, transforming into an electro-house track without ever quite shaking the initial sense of unease: it still feels shadowy and ominous even as it propels you towards the dancefloor. Its record-breaking success made Blinding Lights less a hit than a fact of daily life. You couldn’t escape it, or its subsequent influence: its 80s pastiche sound inspired a string of hits by other artists.

The Weeknd’s debut single offered the sound and mood of Tesfaye’s initial mixtapes in a nutshell: murky, lo-fi music, impassioned vocals, lyrics that are alternately wilfully reprehensible and racked at their own lack of morality.

In a sense, The Hills was the Weeknd returning to the style that had made his name – it’s certainly substantially less poppy than I Can’t Feel My Face or Earned It. But it offered a kind of widescreen take on the sound of his mixtape Trilogy, the musical equivalent of an acclaimed indie director successfully transitioning to mainstream Hollywood. Everything is sharper, bigger, more striking, without losing any of the unsettling power that drew people to it in the first place; it condensed his episodic song structures into four incident-packed minutes.

There is much to relish in Kill the Jockey, not least Nahuel Pérez Biscayart’s wonderfully stone-faced performance as Remo Manfredini, the rider who absolutely, positively has to win his next race in order to keep a gangster off his back. Biscayart plays Remo as though he is the soulful clown in a silent movie, Buster Keaton with a riding crop. He gives the impression of being the bemused lightning rod for events, as opposed to what he really is: an unruly, drug-fuelled rogue agent who is a danger to himself and pretty much everyone else around. “We know all about your unquenchable thirst for disaster,” says leathery Sirena (Daniel Giménez Cacho), the mob boss, in the brief moment of calm between the scene in which Remo performs a slapstick somersault at the starting gate and the moment when he gallops full-tilt at the race-track’s barricades. When the rider leaves the track, it is the cue for the tale to follow suit, because Ortega’s film is only a high-stakes sports thriller on the surface and recognises that genre labels are just costumes to be tried on, then discarded. Now Remo has busted out of the hospital to embark on a meandering, sad-eyed odyssey around Buenos Aires. He has changed his name to Dolores, swapped his jockey ensemble for a lady’s fur coat and a turban of white bandages, and conceivably switched his gender pronouns, too. The authorities suspect brain damage. “Because of his injury, he seems lost in space and time,” says the cop who has been tracking him via the city’s security cameras. Remo’s pregnant girlfriend Abril (Úrsula Corberó) wants him back. Sirena wants him rounded up and dealt with. And there is a teasing hint here that Remo may have been dealt with already, because when he steps on the scales inside the art-deco chemist, the needle barely moves. It is as if the city at night is a spectral limbo, a shadow world; a frontier of the senses where a body can roam free. Ortega shot his first feature at the age of 19 and scored a small hit at Cannes with his 2018 film El Angel, so he has been moving up through the pack, starting to trouble the established favourites. Kill the Jockey competes in Venice’s main competition, where it is pitted against the likes of Maria, the Joker sequel and Pedro Almodóvar’s The Room Next Door. It won’t win, surely not. It’s too skimpy and self-conscious, more a series of gestures than an organic whole. But Ortega frames his action with a delicious high style, interspersing tense standoffs with formal dance sequences. He gives the impression that all his characters are locked in a bizarre hothouse romance, even when they are chasing or attempting to kill one another. The direction is flavoursome and distinctive; his film is a break from the norm. If the tale loses jeopardy when Remo drifts into the city, that is probably in keeping with its mercurial, skittish nature. Kill the Jockey has jumped the fence and abandoned the race. It is away in the rough, merrily doing its own thing.  Kill the Jockey screened at the Venice film festival."

As the players trickle on to the artificial pitch where today’s Bae v Bae friendly match is taking place, I notice their kits are emblazoned with a tiger motif. I’m told it’s a nod to the animal’s presence across multiple Asian cultures, reflecting the ethnic backgrounds of the team that was established for women, trans and non-binary people of Asian heritage. Their matches begin with a “circle of love”, where they gather to share names and pronouns, reaffirming their community purpose and inclusion of trans players. Today’s friendly game will conclude with a Macmillan Coffee Morning – that partnership, too, is a product of intention. “We are championing Macmillan Cancer Support because it centres around people’s needs and provides support for those with cancer, which affects a lot of people beyond the treatment itself,” says Nicole Chui, who founded Baesianz in 2022. “As a community, we know the importance of providing safe spaces.” Macmillan goes beyond what’s expected from a cancer charity. Among its holistic approach to cancer support is advocacy work to influence policy, counselling, and benefits help. Similarly, Baesianz FC offers much more than just football games – it also provides community. “I’ve never felt more like myself, as someone who’s queer, brown and trans, than since joining Baesianz,” says Logan DiFranco, who moved to the UK from the US. “I’ve never really had the opportunity to play sports with other people of colour. I love the circle of love being normalised. For trans people, it’s usually our responsibility to start those conversations. But in this space, the whole team takes part and makes everyone feel comfortable. And that is really rare.” However, being a trans-inclusive, gender-diverse team invariably means negotiating hurdles. “There are still barriers to entry,” says Natalie Chui, a Baesianz FC player and founder Nicole’s sister. “It’s getting more expensive [pitch slots can go for £100 an hour] because the demand is high, but women’s teams aren’t always prioritised.” I’m told even booking the pitch for today’s game was a battle – a male team attempted to pay triple the fee to nab the space. Homemade bakes, balloons and bunting were all on show at Baesianz FC’s Macmillan Coffee Morning As the friendly match gets under way, that bond becomes as clear as the blue sky above. Players are casually subbed on and off, while thank yous and sorrys accompany passes and fumbles. “The Baes have a huge bond, connected by our heritage and love of football, but we also go beyond the sport. We’re all friends,” says Natalie. Once the match is over, players begin setting up for the fundraiser. Having received a Macmillan fundraising kit that included balloons and bunting, they festoon the pitch’s goals. Money boxes complete with QR codes were also provided, so both cash and digital donations can be made. Some players have brought homemade bakes adorned with Macmillan motifs and place them on benches, while the hungrier ones make a beeline for the desserts. After an hour of chasing a ball, the brownies taste better than ever. It’s a Coffee Morning with a twist – there’s not a coffee in sight, and it’s well into the afternoon by the time the festivities begin. But that’s the beauty of a Macmillan Coffee Morning – as long as you’ve got a community, some food to share, and a bit of money to donate, you’ve got everything you need. Since it began in 1990, Macmillan Coffee Morning has diversified into kitchen discos, yoga sessions and even wild swimming meets – so you can do it your way. The final score is scarcely remembered as excited chatter fills the pitch, with players eating, donating and reflecting on the day. Goalkeeper Feitong Wilde, who recently joined, says: “I almost didn’t join because I was a bit scared. As someone who’s half Chinese, I struggled to find other people from mixed-heritage backgrounds to make friends with. Not a lot of people understand the struggles of being mixed, so it’s nice to connect with other Asian people in the same boat.” And no Coffee Morning is too small an event; last year, Macmillan Coffee Morning raised £18m in total. It’s a testament to the collective power of community – something that Baesianz FC has in spades. Want to get involved?

Binoculars are handed out for those who don’t have them, as are raincoats, and people chat so enthusiastically that Olanipekun has to speak up to be heard. Flock Together is a black-led birdwatching collective that runs monthly walks in and around London to help foster connections with the outdoors and bring people of colour together. Olanipekun explains that nature has had a profound impact on his mental health. “I have ADHD so my mind is super active. When I was introduced to nature, and specifically birdwatching, it was the only place I felt absolute peace.” Knowing that mental health can be a taboo topic in black communities and other communities of colour, Olanipekun and co-founder Nadeem Perera saw a chance to help. In 2020, Flock Together was born. Flock Together co-founder Ollie Olanipekun (top right) says that nature has a profound impact on his mental health Previous walks have included trips to Brighton, to see starling murmurations swirl around the pier, and to Richmond Park, to spot woodpeckers and red kites among the deer. Today’s adventure is a little different – it includes a Macmillan Coffee Morning done the Flock Together way. After a wander through Trent Country Park’s rolling green stretches and ancient woodland, the group takes a break for refreshments and conversation. This time, alongside sharing stories, passion projects and animal facts, attendees will enjoy sweet treats in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support. Snacks are laid out on the Macmillan Coffee Morning tablecloth, which doubles as a picnic blanket and, after everyone has helped themselves, Olanipekun invites people to address the group. “This is a space where you look to your left, you look to your right, people have gone through similar lived experiences, similar struggles. They’re here to support you,” he says. The walk was combined with a Macmillan Coffee Morning, with the group sharing snacks and stories while raising money This sense of supportive community is why Olanipekun believes the Macmillan Coffee Morning is a natural fit for Flock Together. “[It’s] such an incredible, simple format and slots into our offering perfectly. It’s bringing people together around a shared cause and just being supportive.” He’s right. Macmillan helps people in the UK who are living with cancer deal with its many and varied impacts – whether they need financial advice they can trust, a listening ear from a Macmillan buddy, or support understanding their diagnosis from a Macmillan nurse. As for Flock Together, on today’s walk people share how the collective has helped them deal with mental health struggles, overcome fears of hiking alone and process grief for loved ones lost to cancer. For Koshii Quarcoopome-Harper, whose son died in 2021 from a cancer that mainly affects young black people with the sickle cell trait, Flock Together events have been a “solace”. She now regularly birdwatches with friends or on her own. “[The outdoors] is still a very white space, but Flock has given me the confidence not to care about that,” she says. The Flock Together organisers are busy people, but incorporating the Coffee Morning into an event they were already running made the process seamless. Semira Badesha, one of the organisers of today’s event, says: “When it’s implemented in a community you’re already a part of, it’s kind of a no-brainer. It’s easy, it’s accessible, and it’s the community coming together to do something even better.” The Coffee Morning phenomenon began in 1990 as a chance to get together over coffee and cake, but has evolved over the years, with organisers adapting the concept for our times. These days, it could be snacks with your sewing circle, a cake stand on your street, a chai afternoon, or a special Sunday dinner with the family. Every amount raised, no matter how small, makes a vital difference for people living with cancer. On Flock Together’s walks, binoculars are handed out to those who don’t have them Speaking of which, at Trent Country Park, it’s time to gather up donations in the Macmillan collection box. It comes included in the handy Macmillan Coffee Morning kit, which also has a sheet of scannable stickers for anyone who doesn’t have cash to hand. “The kit’s really important. Being able to have the QR code for people to donate has been incredibly useful,” says Olanipekun. After the Macmillan snack break, it’s back to nature. The sun is shining over the dramatic scene of a territorial crow dive-bombing a buzzard and the more gentle sight of butterflies basking in the warmth. People are chatting away, connecting over the stories heard and shared in the break. Several people tell me Flock Together’s unique “vibe” of friendliness is what keeps them coming back. And they’re not wrong. The strength of the community here is clear. Want to get involved?

Rewarding, sure, but a big commitment all the same. But what if you could do your bit for a good cause without the stress? Macmillan Coffee Morning is an excellent fundraising opportunity that anyone can get involved with, no matter how little time they have to spare. As one in two people in the UK will develop some form of cancer, Macmillan Cancer Support is needed now more than ever. The charity is all about supporting those with cancer every step of the way. Through its support line and online chat, you can get reassurance about diagnosis and treatment from experienced cancer nurses, as well as expert tips on finances and accessing benefits from Macmillan’s trained and accredited welfare rights advisers. Macmillan even provides grants to help cover the essentials for those who need it – as well as helping those living with cancer to claim the benefits they are entitled to. And if it’s just a chat with someone who really gets it that you need, Macmillan Buddies are always there to listen. That’s not to mention advocacy work on behalf of the 3 million people living with cancer in the UK. Working to cut waiting times and supporting the cancer workforce are all in a day’s work for Macmillan. Inspired to throw a Macmillan Coffee Morning of your own? Here’s our guide to making it a stress-free success. Macmillan Coffee Morning can come to youDon’t be fooled by the name, a Macmillan Coffee Morning can be whatever you make it. You can slot it into your schedule by turning your regular meetups with friends into a Macmillan special. You could host one at work and catch up with colleagues or clients. Part of a running group? Turn your 5K into a “5cake”. Work in a school? Set up a coffee and cake stall for parents to swing by on the school run. You could even host one at home with friends and family, or set up a virtual event that people can attend from wherever they are in the world. Macmillan even has a handy guide to help you plan your event, so don’t worry if you’re not sure where to start. Baking isn’t essentialWhile cakes have become synonymous with a Macmillan Coffee Morning, there’s no need to don your apron if baking isn’t your thing. You could buy some tasty treats or even get in touch with local businesses to see if they’d be willing to donate some. You can also put your own spin on things – so if your friends are more likely to gather for some wine and cheese or a chai afternoon, you can do it in aid of Macmillan. Macmillan’s Coffee Morning kit makes organising easyThe first Macmillan Coffee Morning was held nearly 35 years ago, which means the charity knows a thing or two about pulling off a successful event. That’s why Macmillan has compiled handy kits to make hosting your own Coffee Morning a breeze – including everything you need on the day. From bunting and cake flags (so people know what they’re eating), to fundraising QR codes and paying-in slips that make donating a doddle for you and your guests, it’s all in the kit. There’s also a “lite” version for those who may already have some decorations stashed away or who want to put their own spin on the Coffee Morning concept. Even small donations make a big differenceIf you’re feeling the pressure to raise a huge sum – don’t. Macmillan Coffee Morning is proof that there’s power in numbers. Last year, Macmillan Coffee Morning raised a whopping £18m in total. Even small amounts could have a big impact on the people with cancer who Macmillan supports. For example, £7 could pay for an experienced cancer nurse to put together a personalised care plan, £67 could allow Macmillan’s accredited welfare advisers to deal with a support line enquiry, and £200 could cover a Macmillan grant for a family affected by cancer who are struggling to make ends meet. You can grab mugs, aprons and more from the Macmillan online shopAfter downloading your kit and registering your event, you can go straight to the Macmillan online shop to stock up on Macmillan Coffee Morning plates, napkins, aprons, cake stands and decorations, with proceeds all going towards helping the charity continue its vital work. And if hosting a Macmillan Coffee Morning of your own is more than you can commit to this year, you could always buy a Macmillan Coffee Morning mug and head to your nearest local event.

Whether it’s a birthday, a leaving do, or charity fundraiser, nothing makes faces light up like a slice of something sweet to punctuate the working day. Macmillan Coffee Morning is the perfect reason to dust off your oven gloves and share in the joy of cake with colleagues – on top of a much-needed boost, you’ll be helping to raise vital funds to support the 3m people living with cancer in the UK. But with different allergies and dietary requirements to consider, it’s easy to feel anxious about inadvertently bringing a risky ingredient into the workplace. This showstopping recipe is your low-fuss solution, made without the most common allergens found in cakes – tree and ground nuts, eggs, dairy, gluten and soya. Vegan, kosher and halal to boot, it’s the perfect cake that almost anyone can enjoy. Just be sure to read all your ingredient labels carefully to make sure there’s no risk of trace allergens or cross-contamination … Prep 20 min
 Cook 20 min
 Chill 4-5 hr
 Serves 10-12 For the chocolate mousse 400ml plant-based milk 40g caster sugar
  200g soy-free dark chocolate, 65%-75% cocoa solids For the chocolate cake 150g soy-free dark chocolate, at least 65% cocoa solids, chopped 340ml oat milk
  40g extra-virgin olive oil
  70g cornflour
  80g caster sugar
  1⁄4 tsp baking powder
  Pinch of sea salt For the mousse, bring 200ml of the milk to a simmer with the caster sugar in a medium saucepan. Put the chocolate in a heatproof jug or bowl, pour the milk over, and blend with a stick blender until combined. Add the remaining chilled milk to the jug or bowl and blend again until the mixture is very glossy and you can see a shiny reflection of light with no oily streaks (if you have a thermometer, it should have reached 30-35C), then pour into a shallow dish. Cover with clingfilm – press it on to the surface – and leave to chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours. This will create a ganache-like cream that you will whip and spread on top of the chocolate cake base. To make the base, heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/gas 5. Line the sides and base of a 23cm springform cake tin with baking parchment. Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Heat the oat milk (or a coconut alternative) to a simmer and pour over the chocolate. Add the olive oil and whisk well to create a ganache. In another bowl, use a whisk to combine the cornflour, caster sugar, baking powder and a large pinch of sea salt. Add these dry ingredients to the bowl of ganache and use a silicone spatula to mix until combined. Pour the batter into the lined tin and tap to level the mixture. Bake for 18-20 minutes until the top springs back slightly when pressed with your fingertips. Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely. When you are ready to assemble the cake, it’s time to whisk up the mouse. Chill a mixing bowl for 5 minutes, scrape the chilled chocolate cream into it, and whisk by hand or in a stand mixer until it forms stable peaks. Spread on top of the cooled chocolate cake in the tin. Return to the fridge for another 20 minutes before serving. Remove the cake from the tin, peel away the baking parchment and carefully transfer to a serving plate. Want to get involved?

When we first got together he was father to a two-year-old. His marriage had already broken down and the divorce was bitter. His daughter, who only stays every other weekend, is a beautiful girl. I love her very much. I always took time and care to help make her birthdays amazing. Going the extra mile to decorate the house, arranging parties and food and buying thoughtful presents … lots of them. When it is Father’s Day or her dad’s birthday, even when she was very little, I helped her make cards and token gifts for him, or reminded her to bring something on her next visit. What upsets me is that she is 15 now. I’ve known her since she was two. I have never received a birthday gift, card, squiggle on a paper or any acknowledgment at all that it’s my birthday. Obviously mostly because my partner didn’t feel it was worth the effort to remind her or encourage her. But now she is older, has a decent allowance, and is perfectly able to plan amazing gifts for her friends. Even so I’ve never received a thing beyond the message I got last year. I expect this year will be the same. If this happens I would like to sit both of them down and explain how hurt I’ve been by this, acknowledge her father’s part in not instigating anything when she was young and state that I simply opt out of buying her gifts any more now that she is older, informed and still can’t be bothered. Am I wrong? Eleanor says: It sounds as though you’ve put a lot of effort in and not got a lot back. That always stings. But before saying you’re done with gifts, I think there are a couple of tempering considerations. One is about why she isn’t doing this. We tend to give gifts and assurances of how we feel most often when the other person might not have certainty about how we feel. Because we want to remove any doubt, we give lots of symbols that show our feelings: think how many more tokens of affection there are in courtship than 50 years into the marriage. (Perhaps part of why you made so much effort for her was to remove any possible doubt about whether her step-parent loved her?) The trap is, if we’re confident the other person knows how we feel, sometimes we don’t bother with symbols that show it. That’s a shame. Everybody likes to hear “you’re loved” even when they already know it. Maybe she doesn’t buy you gifts because she assumes there’s no need; her love goes so without saying, there’s literally no need to say it. She might not realise there could have been any question on your part about whether she’d love you back, and so any role for reminders that she does. Another consideration is how much this falls to her dad. It’s striking that you did the reminding and arranging so she’d have gifts on Father’s Days and birthdays (maybe you still do?). That mental-keeping-track so often falls to the women in the house. It sounds as though part of why you’re hurt is that he didn’t teach these rituals of consideration for you, in the way you did for him. We want to be careful calling that her thoughtlessness. It might be worth talking to her dad first, to point out the gap in emotional work: “I don’t need anything big, but it hurts my feelings a bit that you didn’t remind her to mark my days the way I did for yours.” The last thing is that she’s 15. Things are going well in adolescence if the worst thing you do to your parents is take them for granted. You say she’s older and informed now, but in truth a lot of people make it to their 20s or 30s before fully seeing their parents as people. The childhood view of parent-figure as somehow both God and part of the furniture can take a long time to fully lift. Again, that doesn’t mean you have to like it. But it means the explanation might be adolescence instead of insult and neglect. Saying you’re done with gifts at the same moment you say this has been bothering you might feel like a rupture. If what you really want is to be cherished more, and to have your birthday feel nicer, you might have to ask for that. If it’s true you’d like some reassurance about whether she values you, it might even be worth saying that. Maybe not to her, on the principle that one should be careful about exposing emotional vulnerabilities to teenagers. But at least to her dad. Part of the deal of parenthood is never quite getting back the same love you put in. But a cake and a present isn’t a lot to ask for. I’d start with making sure they know how much it would mean.

What do you think of when you read the following? Plaid. Workwear. Camo. If it isn’t words such as practical, hardwearing, hunting or fishing then you’ve been drinking from fashion’s well for too long. Because while in recent years luxury labels have turned all of the above into catwalk fodder, these are the clothes equivalents of agriculture, land, the great outdoors. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more. They also just happen to be the cornerstones of vice-president nominee Tim Walz’s style. He wore an LL Bean barn jacket while on a farm last November, and was spotted in a camouflage cap after he got the call from Kamala Harris asking him to be her running buddy. His wardrobe is all Carhartt, fleeces, jeans, Red Wing boots and worn-in T-shirts. Because, offstage and off-duty, away from the national stage and at home in Minnesota, Tim Walz is “a regular guy”. Or, a regular Nebraska-born former high school football coach with a gun licence, a penchant for ice fishing and 24 years in the National Guard under his well-worn leather belt, an extra hole teased into it with a Swiss army knife. Commentators have been quick to define his style as possessing “a kind of down-home lack of fuss” and his vibe as “a white guy who exudes midwestern dad energy”. He can wear the kind of quote unquote normal clothes that many voters wear and not look like he is trying to cosplay as a salt-of-the-earth kind of guy. He wears patinated Carhartt with the ease of someone who has been wearing it for years. He wears clothes to actually do the thing they were intended for, not to weaponise whatever said thing is symbolic of – hunting clothes to hunt, for instance, as opposed to hunting clothes on the campaign trail in a bid to harness the optics of hunting. “Democrats want to foreground that he wears these clothes not to appeal to a middle-class voter from middle America; he wears them because he is a middle-class voter from middle America,” wrote Washington Post fashion writer Rachel Tashjian in a recent column. But most of all, commentators – and the Democrats keen to translate workwear jackets into “blue wall” votes – have been keen to flag the authenticity of his plaid and boots. “You can tell those flannel shirts he wears don’t come from some political consultant,” said former president Barack Obama recently. “They come from his closet – and they have been through some stuff.” This kind of rural sartorial “authenticity” isn’t the kind of thing you can buy. It just is. And, realistically, sartorial authenticity to many male politicians is navy blue suits and ties and not the hard hats and big boots they favour for site visits and more masculine-coded events. Others have succeeded in signalling their own brand of authenticity – whatever that looks like in their case – long before Walz was mentioned as a prospective ticket mate. Bernie Sanders, for one. As Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland said back in 2020 of the Vermont scruffbag-millionaire: “A politician who does not appear to have been styled by advisers … immediately conveys through their dress that they are different – that they are their own person, that they listen to their conscience rather than to spin doctors and handlers, that they are people of principle and conviction and that, perhaps, they care too deeply about serious issues to be bothered with such trivia as their personal appearance.” Many politicians before have tried to style or spend their way out of appearing elitist or out-of-touch. On that side of the Atlantic, there was Florida governor Ron DeSantis who looked like an alligator out of water in fishing shirts on the campaign trail or Texas governor Rick Perry wearing a too-stiff barn jacket. On this side, any excuse to bring up William Hague on a log flume in a baseball cap with “HAGUE” on it. And Rishi Sunak, who could no more hide that he is a quarter-zip sweater kind of guy with a fortune of £650m than he could make anyone believe that he had owned the enormous Timberland boots he wore to speak to Border Force crews “for ages”. In truth, he couldn’t win: he was also lambasted for wearing Prada loafers to a building site, which were far more authentically him. It isn’t just a pitfall for rightwing politicians: see former barrister Keir Starmer in military fatigues for one example. There is very much a double standard here. As Tashjian writes: “It’s funny to imagine a political party foregrounding a woman’s down-to-earth wardrobe: we just love the senator for wearing those Lululemon leggings. To be taken more seriously, at this level of politics, a man dresses down and a woman dresses up.” It’s a good point – in fact, maybe it is why Kamala Harris’s Converse seem to have been taking a back seat. Sign up to Fashion Statement Style, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solved after newsletter promotion There is another layer to all of this, because how much any of Walz’s authentic workwear will actually translate into rural votes is yet to be seen. But it certainly feels like a stronger sartorial bid than most and one that may well do the unthinkable, making politicians’ style something to aspire to rather than deride, something that causes a spike in Carhartt or peak in plaid as opposed to killing off a look, as Sunak did to Sambas.

Married with five children, they have seen each other through cancer and have moved to the other side of the world and back As a student in the early 1970s, Chris was enjoying life at Auckland University. “I was studying history and classics, and dating a girl called Plonie,” he says. Their romance fizzled, but they decided to stay friends. “We didn’t see each other that often, but she started going out with one of my best friends, Brian, so we were still in touch.” In 1976, Brian married Plonie, and they had a housewarming party to celebrate moving in together. By then, Chris was a postgraduate student, studying for a master’s in Roman and Greek history. At the party he spotted Joke, Plonie’s younger sister. Although he had seen her before, they had never properly spoken. “We were sitting on the floor and we started talking,” he says. “I don’t think we stopped all night. I just remember going home and thinking what an interesting person she was.” Joke, who is from the Netherlands but settled in New Zealand at the age of 10, was immediately taken by Chris. “There had been a few children at the party and I liked the way he was playing with them. I thought he seemed kind and caring.” When they chatted, she told him about the aromatherapy course she was taking and her ambition to work with aromatherapy in care homes. “He really listened to me,” she says. A week later, Chris took the bus across town to visit Joke at her family home. “I saw her parents and they must have thought: ‘Oh, this guy’s back – he’s after another daughter now!’” he says, laughing. But Joke was impressed that he had made the journey and they agreed to meet to see a film a few days later. “I’d promised my little brother I’d take him, so Chris ended up coming along with us,” she says. “But we had a great time together.” They soon began seeing each other regularly, meeting up for dinner or cinema dates. Despite his history with Plonie, there was no awkwardness between Joke and her sister. “She’d long moved on and was really happy for us,” she says.

We'll contact you to arrange an interview Shortly after they met, Joke started a nursing course in Hamilton, about 120km south of Auckland. “We organised to meet up every week – either he’d take the bus to me or I’d take the two-hour trip to Auckland,” she says. In January 1978, they got married in Auckland at the university chapel, and Joke got pregnant soon after. “I wasn’t even halfway through my nursing course, but once I got pregnant I left, as I didn’t think I could manage both.” The couple now have five children. Chris became a teacher after they married, and they moved to Waiheke Island, a rural part of New Zealand, to bring up their family. “There were only 3,000 people living there,” says Chris. Joke was a stay-at-home mum when the children were young, and later worked in IT, accounts and marketing. They lived on Waiheke Island for 20 years, before deciding they wanted a change in 2002. “By then, our eldest was 18, so we decided to move to London,” says Chris. “I remember stepping off the train at Oxford Circus and realising there were more people on one street than on the whole of Waiheke Island.” Despite the culture shock, they loved it. Joke found work with a charity and Chris taught history at a school in Romford. “The first term was challenging because it was so different, but the kids I worked with were great, and we loved the history and culture of the city.” After three years, they moved back to New Zealand and settled in Taumarunui. Now both retired, when they can, they visit their children and six grandchildren, who are based in Australia, New Zealand and Wales. They also meet regularly with Plonie, Brian and their family. In 2021, Joke fell ill with stomach and oesophageal cancer. “While I was in hospital, Chris came to see me every day. We’re just naturally there for each other,” she says. While she was recovering from surgery, Chris was diagnosed with prostate cancer. “It was very unlucky,” he says. “My treatment was a doddle in comparison to what Joke went through, but she’s all good now and we’re both in remission.” He describes her as a “legend” and a wonderful person. “She’s so loving and kind – she’s the best wife in the world.” Joke appreciates Chris’s positivity and cheerfulness. “The best thing about our marriage is that we’re best friends. That’s really important – you’ve got to have that friendship as well as attraction.”"

Is it worth it? I sent my husband for a wax to find out You may have seen the adverts before the Paris Olympics. Tom Daley, in what Pink News called a “thirsty” campaign for Gillette, is in his skimpy trunks, washboard abs and … almost no body hair. The new razor for more intimate body parts is, Daley said on Instagram, “for when it really, really matters”. This is fair enough – he is a diver, after all. But then why is footballer Jude Bellingham, modelling Skims underwear, also apparently hairless? And has Love Island banned male body hair altogether? Hairless men are nothing new, of course. But what makes Daley’s Gillette advert a break from the hairless men of adverts past is that – between the tiny trunks and the close-up footage – the picture invites you to think that this is more than just a trim of unwanted tuftiness: the modern man now shaves everything. “More and more guys across the UK are grooming their intimate area,” a spokesperson for Gillette said, launching the range, “but until today we didn’t offer products with purpose-built features for such a sensitive and complex job.” Sensitive, complex – yes, I can see that applies physically. But intimate male grooming – or “manscaping” as it’s known – is also culturally sensitive and complex. Nearly half of all British men regularly shave their bodies, according to Mintel. There’s a youth bias, predictably; that same UK research shows 57% of 16- to 24-year-old males trim their pubic hair. And while some women have been shaving or plucking or laser-removing or waxing for centuries, how did we get to a point where men have decided that body hair is their problem, too? “Gay men for a long time were waxing their chests and trimming their pubic hair,” says Silva Neves, a London-based sex and relationship therapist. “That’s definitely for aesthetics. There is a sense of perfectionism in the gay male scene, and a hairless torso would be considered perfect, just as hairless women are traditionally considered perfect for the male gaze.” In 2012, David Beckham appeared in underwear ads for H&M; of course you couldn’t see whether he’d had his crack and sack waxed, but everything you could see had been depilated. This was considered to spur a gay-to-straight crossover and suddenly everyone wanted a “boyzilian” like Beckham. A survey by Lovehoney, a sex toy company, later found that eight in 10 men under 35 did regular rudimentary manscaping (a trim with a pair of scissors). Balls.co, purveyor of ball-shavers and body-grooming apparatus, was founded in 2018 by Matt Edge and Tyler Ball, who said they were inspired after a relative confessed to them he trimmed his nethers with a pair of kitchen scissors. Its chief executive, James Weiss, bought the company for an undisclosed sum at the back end of Covid, and will only say business is going “very, very well”. The boom in the manscaping market is part of a wider surge in spending on male grooming, up 77% year-on-year to last January. Still, there is a certain taboo around manscaping. For the purposes of this article, I have spoken to men who get everything waxed, and men – one man, I love this man – who says he shaves his armpits so he doesn’t have to buy deodorant as often. But not one of the many salons I approached to ask if I could visit to see what was happening would agree to have me (I guess they must have some kind of Hippocratic oath?). Eventually, I had to make my husband go undercover and get his crack waxed. Relax – there is absolutely zero chance I’m not going to tell you how that went. Before that, a bit on why and how we got here. It does not appear to be a pornification story – the aesthetics of pornography migrating into the mainstream and affecting what we do with our bodies. “I don’t think it’s nearly as much related to porn as one might guess,” Weiss says. “When we were first looking at this business, I thought: this is going to be 15- to 24-year-old men, lad culture, trying to look as big as possible. That’s not the primary customer set.” Rather, Neves says, these are actually quite mainstream aesthetics. “A lot of the actors we see now tend to be hairless, and it’s a mindset that doesn’t necessarily reflect sexual preferences.” That’s borne out by a 2021 YouGov survey, in which 51% of women said they actively disliked it when men removed all their pubic hair. That leaves a lot of women who do like a hairless man, though. Alex, 33, got his first crack and sack wax last month, having previously “shaved everything down there, maybe once every two or three months, and got a bit fed up with it”. He does it because his wife likes it – “the less hair down there the better. It doesn’t make a difference to me.” He’s extremely pleased with the results, and has already rebooked. Even if trimming, grooming and plucking aren’t what everyone wants, they definitely reflect what we think we want from each other. In 2017 an American study of 7,500 adults found that “the majority of men report grooming in preparation for sexual activity with a peak prevalence of 73% among men aged 25 to 34 years”. It’s not about making sex more pleasurable, but more about looking like you’ve made an effort. Which is a bit of a dicey game; manners are nice, but too much perfectionism is anhedonic. “If you really worry about how good you look while you’re having sex, you’re moving away from the pleasure sensation that’s happening in your body,” Neves says. “You can actually have pretty boring sex, if the connectivity is not felt.” If you’re wondering how dating standards changed, from it being totally normal to turn up as nature made you to a degree of topiary being standard – well, that has partly tracked the homogenisation of dating itself, via the apps. Maybe I’m wrong, but I feel sure that, before Bumble and Tinder, most women wouldn’t have gone out with an expectation of how neat someone’s pubes would turn out to be, still less infer from that whether or not he was a decent guy. On social media generally, Weiss says, “influencers are so relevant. No question in my mind, if we think about the impacts that have driven the growth of this business, it is about the availability of information. Instagram and TikTok have enabled so many different niches of customer need to be satisfied through custom-built product demand.” But not everything, not even everything about pubic hair, is about sex: “A much more relevant customer segment is the athlete,” Weiss says. That doesn’t just mean Olympians, but anyone who is working to get better at their sport. “There are plenty of people who have been shaving their legs, their thighs, their groins, their chests, for years,” Weiss says, “for biking, for swimming, for performance. This side of personal grooming is really significant.” He says it also generates a lot of knowledge exchange. Weekend fitness warriors can talk about their performance for ever; they can lose an afternoon debating the merits of an energy drink, so a possible remedy for groin-chafing is definitely up for discussion. So there are men who trim their balls to be polite for a second date, men who shave their inner thighs to get less drag on a bike and men who wax their chests because they think Bellingham does – but Weiss says the men who will go to a salon for complete hair removal are still the outliers. He doesn’t see waxing as a huge challenger to the trimmer market yet. “For most men, it’s not something they’re willing to invest the time and money into, and there’s always the vaguely homophobic thing: ‘I don’t want another person down in those parts.’” Yet we know men are getting boyzilians, because salons do offer them. My main worry, when I asked my husband to do it, is that he’d come back sketchy on the detail, the way (some) men are when you ask them what the dog-sitter said, or why their parents divorced. Oh boy. No, he was not sketchy: “In my whole life as a man I have never felt so exposed and on display.” Right. I forgot this about men: he’s never had a smear test or a mammogram, he’s never had his eyebrows plucked, he’s never even had his legs waxed. “I have never been handled like that. Like a carcass!” Do men even take their clothes off, except for when something fun is about to happen (sex, or swimming, or going to sleep)? Not really, I don’t think. I have put myself in the most astronomical debt to him, for an article. And, um, did it hurt? Something else I forgot – he’s had his share of headaches, but he’s never had, like, you know, pain pain. He’s never given birth. It would have been worse if it was his back, the waxer told him, and the most painful area is the chest. He takes a deep breath, for this unbroken soliloquy: “The hot wax goes on; it’s only just too hot to be pleasant. Then it hits the arsehole and it’s way over the line. If I had to put the pain in order it would be: the astringent added after, the indignity of the position, hot wax on my actual anus, Rock DJ coming on to Radio 2 and then the ripping bit.” Later that day, I was telling a hairdresser about the crack wax, and she said, “You’ve made my day,” and I said, “That’s nothing, I made his hole weak!” Never seen that old chestnut out in the wild before. I felt like the world’s best truffle pig. To look on the bright side, that sounds like a very professional job of manscaping, unlikely to leave long-term effects which, the Daily Mail recently reported, could include gangrene: it’s a bit of a slippery slope notion, but all the individual steps make sense. First, men tend to shave their own pubic areas, rather than going to a wax technician; so they do it wrong, perhaps using blades that are too sharp, which can lead to folliculitis, where hair follicles get inflamed. There’s also a lot of bacteria in the area, increasing the risk of infection. But the worst case scenario is Fournier gangrene, which eats the flesh of the scrotum, penis and perineum, and is caused by minute wounds in a moist environment. God knows I’m not a doctor, but if I were in the business of dispensing medical advice, I’d say, definitely go to a salon or, at a bare minimum, get a Gillette. That’s what Tom Daley would do. Does this represent a more equal world, where men put themselves through the same things women do, with the same aim of pleasing a gaze that may exist, or may have been invented by shaving companies? Is this a more sophisticated understanding of gender and sexuality, where body confidence is not about how male or female you look, how gay or straight, but about how you you look? I don’t know yet. Much more field work needed.  Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He had this strong view about influencers making people think they had to have a certain body type or look a certain way. He said social media and the tabloids are in a bad state, and people having surgery reflects that. Mark Karaca had a “why do you care?” sort of attitude. At the end of the day, it’s up to people to do what they want. So we didn’t disagree that much. Then we talked about gender affirmation surgery. It’s a much more complex area than cosmetic surgery. He’s much more knowledgable than me. I don’t know anyone with gender dysphoria. So talking to him, getting some insight, did change my perspective.

Somebody’s homeless or hungry, they wouldn’t care if someone misgendered them.” We had a gender-fluid member of staff waiting our table. I said: “We don’t know that person’s pronouns, what’s the issue?” And he said: “It’s such a big issue at work. They write it at the end of the email. You’re always worrying you’re going to make a mistake.” I think it’s an easy thing, if you make a mistake, that’s no problem, so long as you’re trying to get it right. Mark My problem with woke culture is that it becomes as prescriptive as the views it’s rallying against. And if people don’t believe all the right things, as per the woke playbook, they just get attacked. As well as diversity of people, it’s good to have diversity of thought, and that means people thinking different things to you, and maybe even thinking things that are wrong. And I still believe that to be true. But Karaca’s point is that marginalised groups suffer a lot more, and I do see that. Karaca We talked about Black Lives Matter, the police beating up Black kids. He said we shouldn’t focus on stopping people being racist – that’s like thought control. We just need to stop the end result of that. I’m Turkish, and I was the brownest person in that restaurant. If a group of kids came and threw stones at everyone, then yes we need to stop them throwing stones. But if they’re only throwing them at me, that’s a different thing. Mark I’ve got mixed-race children, and they would not have considered that their lives didn’t matter until they heard the term “Black Lives Matter”. My concern is that you’re propagating this idea that Blackness is a thing, when it was only ever a thing because of the racism in the first place. A Black guy in London will have much more in common with me than with a Black guy in Botswana. If you focus on racism as the motive, you’re reinforcing the idea of race and otherness.

He also carries a first-aid kit in case he or any of his students is hit by a bullet. “I always have it in my backpack because I could be shot at any time,” he said, displaying the red waterproof bag after attending a seminar on how police operations are affecting children’s learning in Maré. A complex of 15 favelas housing 125,000 people in Rio, Maré on Thursday reached its 11th consecutive day of police operations that are demolishing buildings allegedly constructed by drug traffickers. This time there were no shootings – which are common during such actions and often result in the deaths of innocent residents – but a less visible result emerged: schools had to be closed for more than a week. About 20,000 students attend the 49 schools in Maré, which is located between downtown Rio and its international airport. Only on Wednesday did the schools reopen – yet many parents were still fearful and decided to keep their children at home, leaving many classrooms empty – bringing the total number of school days lost this year due to security forces’ incursions to 29. “It’s inconceivable to imagine 30 days of police operations in Leblon, Ipanema, and Copacabana,” said Eblin Farage, a social work professor at the Federal Fluminense University, referring to wealthy neighbourhoods in Rio’s South Zone. “So why is it possible in Maré? Don’t the people here count as part of the city?” Farage coordinated a new study with the NGO Redes da Maré that interviewed 84 children and teenagers aged 10 to 15. Two-thirds (66.7%) said that when their school closes due to a police operation, the content that should be taught during the closure is never covered again. For 92%, “violence” – in a general context, which also includes the actions of criminal groups – disrupts classes and learning; for 78%, it increases the loss of concentration during school activities. “But the losses aren’t just educational,” said Alessandra Pinheiro, education coordinator at Redes da Maré. “For many of these children, the food provided by the school is the only meal they will have in a day,” she said, adding: “It’s also about the right to have a future.” A book published this year, Eu devia estar na escola (I should be at school), reproduces drawings created by children from Maré at the NGO’s request. One asks: “How are we supposed to achieve our dreams when we miss so many classes?” Maria dos Prazeres, 39, who left the north-eastern state of Rio Grande do Norte to live in Maré with her husband and their two children, has spent the past week looking for ways to entertain her youngest, Isaías. “He’s five, has autism and loves studying. He becomes very agitated at home when he misses classes, so I have to focus entirely on him,” she said. With so many days of staying at home, she lost her job as a shrimp peeler at a small fish shop in Maré. Now her husband is her household’s sole breadwinner. “I liked having my own money, but I’m afraid to return to work. What if there’s another operation tomorrow?” she asked during the seminar organised by Redes da Maré. Science teacher Brandão wore a yellow shirt to the seminar featuring a logo with two raised black hands and the message “Education, don’t shoot”. He says carrying around a first-aid kit should never be normalised. “I can’t feel comfortable carrying this … We must fight to ensure that people in Maré have all their rights, such as to come and go and to education,” he said. During the seminar, a speaker mentioned that some teachers, when assigned to work in Maré, quit out of fear after the first day. Brandão asked for the microphone: “I’m not afraid of working here. What I’m afraid of is being shot during a police operation. I’m tired of losing former students this way.” On Tuesday, a federal prosecutor gave Rio’s city hall a 48-hour deadline to explain why the buildings are being demolished and to present a plan for making up the lost classes. A department of education spokesperson said that students will be offered remedial activities, such as video lessons or thematic classes. Farage believes that police operations need to end in Maré, as they “don’t impact drug trafficking significantly”. But advocating for this, she says, is not condoning organised crime, which does indeed control parts of the favelas. Last Sunday, police discovered a ton of marijuana hidden in air ducts outside a school. According to the education department, criminals invaded the school grounds, “a space that should be sacred”, to conceal the drug. “We know that the police are not the only problem in the favelas, but there should be other forms of public security that actually provide safety, rather than the oppression that exists today,” said Farage. “The state cannot be a violator of rights.”"

During more than 10 months of fighting between Hezbollah and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) near her village of Zebqine, she had grown used to hearing the explosions that have devastated other nearby villages. So far, Zebqine, almost 7km from the Lebanese-Israeli border, had been spared the worst of the shelling. But this time, she says, “it was right on top of us. It smashed the windows; the whole place shook. The children were panicking.” It was the fiercest fighting since hostilities began in October. The IDF says that 100 jets took part in the bombardment, while Hezbollah fired more than 340 rockets at 11 military targets in Israel. It was finally enough to convince Barakat to leave Zebqine. The following day, she travelled the 17km (10 miles) to the coastal city of Tyre with her husband, parents and two young children, checking into a shelter run by the local authority. They join the growing number of displaced people in Lebanon that has risen from less than 99,000 to 112,000 in the past month amid a rising number of airstrikes across the country. Yet, even as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) warns that this number is likely to rise with people fleeing new areas of the country, such as the eastern Bekaa Valley and the southern suburbs of Beirut, aid organisations report a slump in donations for relief activities. Barakat’s family was one of 88 who arrived at the shelter after the fighting on Sunday. Almost 30,000 displaced people currently live in Tyre, more than any district in Lebanon. The municipality hosts 309 families across five shelters, but thousands more are living in rented or borrowed accommodation in the city, reliant on food parcels and hygiene kits. As fighting has worn on, the authorities have had to do more with less. With the central government still in the grip of an economic crisis, the city depends on charitable organisations to support the displaced. But since October, the number of major donors for the city’s relief efforts has dropped from 51 to five, after many charitable organisations said they do not have the resources to back such a long-term operation. “Nobody expected it would last this long,” says the shelter’s manager, Mortada Mhanna. “They expected one week, two weeks, but not a year.” As a result of funding cuts, the centre has had to slash the number of hot meals it gives residents from three a day to just one. “What we are providing as the international community is not enough,” says Hans Bederski, national director at World Vision, one of the shelter’s remaining supporters. “We are set up just to provide the basics for survival: food and a roof over people’s heads, and even that is stretched.” World Vision says it is struggling to keep up education services for children out of school and much-needed psychosocial support for young people experiencing trauma and stress-induced behavioural issues. Those who end up in free shelters tend to be the most vulnerable. The vast majority – about 98% of displaced people – have found temporary accommodation in rented housing, second homes, with family members or with strangers. There are reports across the country of people opening their doors to those who are displaced. At the same time, some areas have seen a hike in rents due to “exploitation of the crisis by landlords, real estate companies and brokers”, according to Christina Abou Rouphaël, a researcher at the Beirut-based thinktank Public Works, who has tracked rental properties since the start of the conflict. IOM officials say the proportion of people living in shelters could rise further as displaced people’s savings are whittled down by months in exile, making it harder to meet rising rent prices. Job opportunities for displaced people are not always adequate. Lebanon is suffering from a five-year economic crisis, exacerbated by the border clashes since October, which, according to the Lebanese government, have cost the country a further $10bn – more than a third of its GDP – in physical damage and lost revenue.

They included Faten Khaled. Now 41, she was in her mid-20s when she left her home village of Yarine during the last war. They were gone for just 15 days before the fighting subsided and they could return home. When Khaled and her family fled the most recent fighting on 15 October, they expected something similar. “We thought we would be gone for a week, a month at most, and then we’d be back,” she says. Her family of six has been living in the displacement shelter in Tyre for more than 10 months. They receive no monetary support from any government or non-governmental organisation, aside from a $200 monthly stipend that Hezbollah commonly pays displaced residents of the border region. It isn’t enough to make ends meet, and Khaled worries about the impact on her children, who have spent the best part of the last year out of school. “I wish we could just go back home,” she says. Khaled doesn’t know if her home is still standing. Yarine is just 1km from the border – so close that she could see the tanks on the other side. Villages closest to the border have been the most heavily damaged, with entire areas reduced to rubble. Israeli forces have been accused of creating a “dead zone” as a buffer between the two countries. Khaled knows of nobody left in Yarine who can tell her how bad the damage has been. “There’s not a soul that still lives there now,” she says. “Probably even the birds have been killed in the crossfire.”"

Trump is certain to continue his day-to-day campaign work until the debate on 10 September: he has a busy travel schedule that will see him do a town hall event in Wisconsin and a rally in Pennsylvania this week, after his visit to the Arlington national cemetery became mired in controversy. ​He has also had some success in cutting through the news cycle in recent days, including when he took over headlines at the end of last week when Robert F Kennedy Jr gave his endorsement. ​But the reality is that good news has been in short supply. Since Joe Biden exited the race in July and Harris rapidly replaced him, her campaign has flipped the narrative, turning a consistent Biden loss in the polls into a narrow but solid Harris lead. With Trump struggling to frame the narrative against Harris, the general posture inside campaign leadership is to write off the regular programming that won’t change the race – and look to a debate that might. The pivot to praying Trump does well at the debate is practical, even if writing off two weeks is unusual. Trump can perform on stage, and knocked opponents back in 2016 and 2020 and against Biden in 2024 with sarcastic quips and an avalanche of disorientating false claims. The campaign also feels that Trump can use the debate as an opportunity to get across to a national primetime audience his messaging points criticizing Harris on policy – accusing Harris of allowing waves of illegal immigrants and not cracking down on crime – that have so far not broken through. As the reasoning goes, even if the television networks decline to air Trump’s rallies or remarks criticizing Harris day-to-day, they will be forced to air Trump and his attack lines when he has the floor. Trump’s advisers have also been buoyed by the likelihood that microphones will be muted when it is not a candidate’s turn to speak, believing it defangs Harris in being able to fact-check him in real time and in her ability to make quips of her own. The muted microphones have been a particularly big deal for Trump’s advisers, who internally have been repeatedly pushing for “CNN rules”, in a reference to the disastrous CNN debate with Biden last month when microphones were muted. It comes as several Trump advisers have warned about Harris’s jabs in debates in 2020: telling Mike Pence: “Mr Vice-President, I’m speaking”, and responding to former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard – now involved in Trump’s debate prep – in the Democratic primary debate with chiding comments."

In a country where politicians often deploy dullness as a prophylactic against charges of demagoguery, Höcke gleefully takes a different tack. In his speeches, he thunders against a familiar cast of the far-right’s villains – immigrants, Islamists, European Union bureaucrats – but he also veers into an anecdotal, lachrymose style so distinctive that even one of Höcke’s closest colleagues told me he used to find it “strange”. His rhetoric of decline and redemption – he has told Germans they must choose between being sheep or wolves, and urged them to be the latter – has garnered comparisons to Joseph Goebbels, whose speeches many political analysts assume he has studied. To his critics, Höcke is one of the gravest threats to Germany’s postwar democracy since it was established. More than any other person, he is responsible for the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party’s metamorphosis from a Eurosceptic, economically liberal movement into a nativist, anti-Islam, climate-denialist party. In 2020, Thomas Haldenwang, the head of Germany’s domestic intelligence service, was asked whether Höcke was a rightwing extremist. “Björn Höcke is the rightwing extremist,” he replied. In the late 2010s, when I was living in Thuringia, the central German state where Höcke heads the AfD, I heard his name come up all the time. But I didn’t really understand why so many people were worked up about him until one day in May 2019, when I went to see him for myself. State elections were approaching and Höcke was due to address a rally in Apolda, a once-prosperous industrial town about a half-hour drive from the Buchenwald concentration camp memorial. Like many towns in former East Germany, Apolda bears the scars of war, deportations and communism’s collapse. Listless at the best of times, in the rainy weather the streets seemed as if they’d been emptied by a plague. In the old town square, a couple of dozen AfD supporters stood huddled by a food truck, smoking cigarettes and eating sausage. An ageing keyboard duo called Easy Tandem sang Love Is in the Air in heavy accents, occasionally muddied by the jeers of anti-fascist protesters. Over the previous few years, Höcke had been busy. In April 2013, the same month the AfD was founded, he set up the party’s Thuringia branch and quickly positioned himself as head of a loose confederation known as The Wing. Defining itself as a “resistance movement against the further erosion of German identity”, The Wing leveraged its numbers to push the AfD far to the right. Many members also seemed eager to downplay Germany’s Nazi past. By the time I saw him in person, Höcke had weathered two attempts to expel him from the AfD, most recently over a speech in which he had decried German self-flagellation over the Nazi era. “We Germans are the only people in the world that have planted a monument of shame in the heart of their capital,” he said, referring to Berlin’s Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Both attempts to expel Höcke were spearheaded by AfD leaders who saw his radicalism as a liability; both times, those leaders ended up leaving the party instead. As the band broke into Gimme Hope Jo’anna, the anti-apartheid song written by Eddy Grant – something of a surprise choice – a black sedan pulled up, and Höcke emerged, dressed in a beige raincoat, white button-up shirt, blazer and jeans. In the lashing wind, the grey coif of his hair betrayed the faintest of ruffles. For several minutes, Höcke slapped hands and posed for photos, and then leaped on to the stage. “The coldest May in 140 years,” he said. Then, with a comedian’s timing: “Strong evidence of man-made climate change.” The crowd laughed; Höcke beamed. If their numbers disappointed him, he offered no sign – he bubbled with the energy of a man addressing a roaring stadium. “Thank you for coming out,” he said. “Maybe you’ve managed to have a couple of beers, and a couple of good conversations, and made one or two new friends. That’s the point of this event: you are not alone.” Over the next hour, I watched as, without notes, Höcke offered figure after figure to corroborate his audience’s vague suspicion that they were getting screwed: 4,000 EU bureaucrats earning salaries of more than €290,000 (“more than the German chancellor!”); €60m wasted in Thuringia each year paying inflated benefits to refugees who fake their ages. “Who gives, and who takes? We Germans, we always give,” Höcke told the crowd. A few months later, Thuringia delivered him an unambiguous vindication. The AfD took nearly a quarter of votes, outpacing the centre-right CDU and nearly tripling the share of the centre-left Social Democrats. Far from consigning the AfD to the wilderness, Höcke had brought the party closer to real power than anywhere else in the country. Five years on, voices critical of Höcke within the AfD – once common in German media – have dissipated. A few months after the 2022 party conference, where Höcke embarrassed the party’s co-leaders, Tino Chrupalla and Alice Weidel, by sponsoring a resolution to dissolve the EU, Der Spiegel declared him the “real boss” of the AfD. Under Höcke’s influence, the party regularly polls as the country’s second-most popular, far ahead of any parties in Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s centre-left coalition. The AfD has won a district government in Thuringia and a municipal government in neighbouring Saxony. On 1 September, elections in those two states and later in the month in Brandenburg, also in the east, could make the AfD the largest party in one or more state parliaments. For years, Höcke’s critics have insisted he represents something much darker than a nationalist strain of conservatism. As evidence of what they see as far more radical convictions, they point to phrases, peppered throughout his speeches, in which Höcke has appeared to echo language of the Third Reich. In 2016, Andreas Kemper, a German sociologist and author, claimed to have identified more than a dozen such instances. These included calls for Germany to have a “thousand-year future” and references to internal AfD rivals as “degenerate”. Both terms are commonplace in German, but critics argue they have a different resonance when uttered by a senior figure in a party enthusiastically backed by neo-Nazis. Other examples, such as his reference to a political opponent as a “Volksverderber” (“corrupter of the people”, used by Hitler in Mein Kampf) or calling his movement the “Tat-Elite” (“action-elite”, used by the SS to describe itself), are more unusual, and harder to explain away. (Höcke did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but Torben Braga, an AfD politician who has worked with him closely, told me that the criticisms were evidence of a “pathological” obsession with tarring every rightwing conservative as a Nazi. “I don’t know anyone, not even the federal president or the federal chancellor, whose every speech is subjected to such deep analysis,” he said.) In Germany, using Nazi slogans is not just distasteful, it is criminal. But nothing Höcke said had ever strayed into prosecutable territory, until May 2021. That month, a Green politician in Saxony-Anhalt noticed that Höcke had ended one of his speeches by saying, “Everything for our homeland, everything for Saxony-Anhalt, everything for Germany.” Innocuous taken at face value, but the last phrase was a slogan used by the Nazi SA paramilitary unit, and carved into its service daggers. The politician brought a criminal complaint, and the public prosecutor filed charges. Höcke, who denied knowing the phrase’s origins, faced up to three years in prison. Earlier this year, ahead of the trial, Höcke declared on X that, “Once again, Germany is at the forefront of persecuting political opponents and suppressing free speech.” When Elon Musk, who had stumbled on the post, asked why using the phrase would be illegal, Höcke responded: “Because every patriot in Germany is defamed as a Nazi.” The criminal code contained provisions “not found in any other democracy”. The point, he said, was “to prevent Germany from finding itself again.” One morning this April, I headed to the city of Halle, in Saxony-Anhalt, for the first day of Höcke’s trial. The case would concern whether he had violated Paragraph 86a of Germany’s criminal code. The law, adopted after the second world war, outlaws the “use of symbols of unconstitutional and terrorist organisations”, which courts have interpreted to apply to a range of Nazi and neo-Nazi imagery and mottoes. The trial was held in a modernist complex built on the site of an old East German car factory. About 200 protesters were outside when I arrived, chanting and holding signs reading “Stop the AfD” and “Björn Höcke is a Nazi”. Inside, the building was drab: smudged tile floors, fluorescent lighting, walls plastered with auction notices for foreclosed homes. Höcke’s name appeared on a list of upcoming cases among instances of theft and cannabis dealing. I was whisked, along with a substantial share of Germany’s press corps, through a metal detector, past a bomb-sniffing dog, and into a chamber of foam-board panels and linoleum so reminiscent of a suburban office that I half expected to spot a cubicle and a photocopier in the corner. A minute later, the line of photographers at the front were jolted into action as Höcke entered. His expression was grave. Three lawyers flanked him. A stack of history books was tucked under one arm. The cameras had just a few minutes to capture the images that would fill the evening news. As with most criminal trials in Germany, photos and recordings were forbidden. The crews were ushered out, and two judges in black robes entered, alongside two lay judges in everyday clothes. (In Germany, volunteer judges perform the function of juries.) The presiding judge, Jan Stengel, had the weary manner of a man who has spent his professional life dealing with difficult people. I had been warned that the first session would probably be dry, technical and short. But Höcke’s defence team had different plans. Before the prosecutors could read out the charges, one of Höcke’s lawyers asked that the proceedings be taped – a striking request in a country where recordings are almost never allowed. “The purpose is to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial,” the lawyer said. As a maligned public figure, Höcke faced the risk of “meaning-distorting truncations” by hostile media. The judge took the motion in stride, but after a recess, it was rejected. Prosecutor Benedikt Bernzen, a towering, bearded man in his early 40s, stood to address the court. “The defendant, Mr Björn Höcke – ” “Stop!” cried a lawyer for the defence. Most of the journalists were familiar with the stout, bald man who had interrupted. Ulrich Vosgerau had made the news a few months earlier when he had joined a meeting in Potsdam between senior AfD officials and a far-right Austrian activist to discuss the “remigration” – a euphemism for mass deportation – of migrants and naturalised Germans. News of the meeting sparked nationwide protests, but left the AfD’s polling figures largely intact. Vosgerau proceeded to reel off a list of complaints, including a demand that the case be relocated to Merseburg, where Höcke’s speech took place, even though that request had already been denied by a higher court. He also asked to end the session early so he could make another appointment. When Bernzen spoke again, he made no effort to conceal his annoyance. “In all my professional years, I’ve never been interrupted during an indictment,” he said. “You stepped over my words,” he told Vosgerau. “That is outrageous.” The AfD is often portrayed as a bull in the china shop of German democracy, flouting norms and decorum in an attempt to undermine institutions of state. When, after five recesses and multiple rejected motions, the hearing finally concluded, it seemed clear that Höcke’s team were not afraid to be seen in the same light. By the time I got back to Berlin, headlines across the country were declaring: “Grotesque appearance in Halle: How Björn Höcke tried to slow down his trial” and “Höcke in court: Bizarre and disturbing.” It is in East Germany that Höcke has built his base. His success comes from his ability to articulate the frustrations and anxieties widely felt in a region where faith in institutions has been shaken by the loss of jobs and pensions, the implosion of an ideological system once portrayed as incontestable, and perceived discrimination at the hands of an arrogant west. Above all, Höcke has channelled these resentments towards migrants and asylum seekers, whom he portrays as free-riders soaking up taxpayer money. But he himself is a child of west Germany, and he was born, ironically enough, to a family of refugees. Before the defeat of the Nazis, Germany’s borders stretched as far east as modern Lithuania. In the war’s final convulsions, the advancing Red Army expelled millions of Germans from the country’s eastern provinces, which were soon made part of Poland. Integrating the Vertriebene, or “expellees”, was among postwar Germany’s most severe challenges. They struggled to find housing in bombed-out cities. Food and jobs were always scarce. Their dialects, though intelligible, fell oddly on west German ears. “They didn’t have a different skin colour and they didn’t come from a different country, but ultimately they were just as much refugees,” says Karsten Polke-Majewski, who went to high school with Höcke and later researched him for the weekly newspaper, Die Zeit. Höcke’s grandparents, who had lived in a hamlet in the former province of East Prussia, were among them. They eventually settled outside Neuwied, a town of about 30,000 people about 60 miles from the border with Belgium. Growing up in West Germany, Höcke would lie in bed beside his grandparents as they told him stories from their lost “homeland”. The images left a deep impression. “They presented it so vividly that I could really feel it,” Höcke said in a 2015 interview. “It certainly nourished a lasting political interest.” German media has found evidence Höcke may have been exposed to more radical views. According to Die Zeit, Höcke’s father’s name appeared on the subscriber list for Die Bauernschaft, a newspaper published through the 1970s and 80s by Thies Christophersen, a prominent Holocaust denier. Höcke’s father also signed a petition in solidarity with a Christian Democrat kicked out of the party for suspected antisemitism in 2004. Polke-Majewski told me that his interviews with neighbours, acquaintances and town notables led him to believe the family remained fairly isolated in Neuwied. After studying history and athletics at university, Höcke took a job teaching at the Martin Buber school in a small town south of Frankfurt. Housed in what Höcke called an “unsightly 70s-era concrete building”, the school, named after the Jewish philosopher and theologian, didn’t always have a shining reputation. One of Höcke’s former students, André Alexander Kiefer, told me that knives and drugs were common. Many students were from migrant families, and small “gangs” often formed along ethnic lines. White Germans turned to metal or far-right rock scenes. “You always had both sides of violent people in that city,” Kiefer told me. Höcke started his job in 2001, when the hard-right was still on the political margins. At 29, with blond hair and an athletic build, he struck an energetic contrast to his older colleagues. But students soon discovered a conservative streak. “The students – many with a migrant background – were not receptive to my educational concerns, including the transmission of German and European cultural traditions,” he said in his book, Never Twice in the Same River, published in the form of an interview with the rightwing journalist Sebastian Hennig. Though he said he stayed on good terms with most students “regardless of their social or ethnic background”, he looked sceptically upon colleagues who “dreamed the dream of a multicultural society and sang the high song of so-called ‘diversity’”. In the book, Höcke tells the story of how, one summer, students started wearing T-shirts with the names of countries printed on them. “Turkey”, “Russia”, and “Italy” shirts were everywhere. Then one morning, a girl showed up in Höcke’s gym class wearing a “Germany” shirt. “The Turkish and African boys were beside themselves,” claimed Höcke. “These otherwise divided Turks and Africans spontaneously agreed in their aggressive rejection of ‘Germanness’.” The next day, Höcke showed up in his own “Germany” shirt, which, to his delight, inspired a couple students to do the same. What Höcke took from his experience was that “humans need a great deal of trust in our everyday interactions, and this is only possible if we can rely on a familiar, safe environment and established customs”. Here was the “great mistake of the multiculturalists”. They didn’t actually take cultures seriously, and instead tried to reduce them to “a bit of exotic folklore and varied gastronomy”. Chaos inevitably followed. “As nice and cosmopolitan as they may seem, at their core, multicultural entities are societies of pure mistrust,” Höcke said. “They automatically create countless frictions and conflicts – even without any bad intentions on the part of the people involved. And that is sold to us as a sunny future.” This message was one he would repeat regularly, with varying degrees of virulence, during his swift rise from obscurity to the heart of German politics. In 2008, when Höcke was 36, he moved to Bornhagen, a town in Thuringia. At the time, he was teaching at a school a 20-minute drive away, across the old east-west border, in the central state of Hesse. His commute traversed one of the sharpest divides in German society: Thuringia had Germany’s second-lowest gross regional product per capita; Hesse, its third highest. Hesse’s largest city, Frankfurt, is known as a financial hub, home to Germany’s Bundesbank and the European Central Bank. Thuringia, by contrast, would soon be known for the National Socialist Underground, a terrorist group that murdered nine immigrants and a police officer during the first part of the decade. In the years before his move to Thuringia, there is almost no public record of Höcke’s political views, but in 2018, Die Zeit uncovered compelling evidence that he was in contact with far-right circles during this period. The newspaper reported that Höcke was assisted in his move to Bornhagen by Thorsten Heise, an activist in the neo-Nazi National Democratic party (NDP). Neighbours told the paper that Heise, who lived nearby, visited Höcke regularly. More damningly, a video surfaced showing Höcke chanting during a neo-Nazi march in Dresden on the anniversary of the city’s bombing in 2010. (Braga, the AfD politician, told German media that Höcke had merely gone to get an “impression” of the event.) Kemper, the sociologist, has alleged that Höcke went further, by authoring several articles in publications run by Heise under the name “Landolf Ladig”. The articles, published in 2011 and 2012, argued that the world wars were started by foreign powers jealous of German “industry” and praised NDP economic policies aimed at “overcoming inhumane global capitalism” and encouraging the births of more “German children”. Some of the language in these articles was strikingly similar to phrases that later appeared in Höcke’s speeches, including particular descriptions of Bornhagen and the recommendation of a book that both “Ladig” and Höcke referred to by the same wrong name. In 2019, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency said it was “almost indisputable” that Höcke wrote the articles. (Höcke has denied this, but has not taken legal action against Kemper over the claim.) If there was once a time when Höcke needed underground outlets to express his views, that changed in 2013 with the establishment of the AfD. Founded in response to the eurozone debt crisis, the party took its name from former Chancellor Angela Merkel’s assertion that there was “no alternative” to bailouts for southern Europe. Höcke set up the party’s Thuringian branch and won office in state elections in autumn 2014. In March the following year, he burst into national consciousness when he co-authored the “Erfurt declaration”, which decried the AfD’s direction under its co-founder, Bernd Lucke, and laid the foundations for what would become The Wing. Höcke’s activism did not endear him to the more moderate members of the AfD, which was roughly split between economic liberals and those of a more nationalist bent. In May 2015, Lucke tried to have Höcke booted from the party after Höcke told journalists that he didn’t “assume that every single member of the NPD” – the neo-Nazi party to which Heise belonged – “can be classified as extremist”. At the party congress in July, however, Lucke was voted out in favour of a new leader, the hardliner Frauke Petry, and the proceedings against Höcke were soon dropped. (When I contacted Lucke, he told me he had spoken about Höcke enough and had “better things to do than constantly repeat himself”.) The experience did not push Höcke to soften his tone. In November 2015, he appeared at an event hosted by a thinktank run by Götz Kubitschek, a prominent rightwing publisher and intellectual. In his speech, Höcke outlined what he called the different “reproductive strategies” of Africans and Europeans. While Africans “aimed at achieving the highest possible growth rate” and migrating to other regions, Europeans did pretty much the opposite, having fewer babies and making “optimal use” of their environment. The collision of these two “strategies” necessitated “a fundamental reassessment of the direction of Germany’s asylum and immigration policy”. A little over a year later, in Dresden’s historic Watzke ballroom, he delivered what would become his most infamous speech. Dismissing Germany’s policy of Holocaust remembrance as a “stupid coping mechanism”, he claimed Germans possessed “the mentality of a totally vanquished people”. He called for a “180-degree turn in the politics of remembrance”, in favour of an approach that “brings us into contact with the great achievements of those who came before us”. The Dresden speech prompted a second attempt to boot Höcke out of the AfD, this time led by his erstwhile ally, Frauke Petry, who called him a “burden on the party”. The party’s federal board declared that he had an “excessive proximity to National Socialism”. Despite the heavier guns brought to bear, Höcke was spared expulsion once again. In May 2018, after more than a year of internal party wrangling, the arbitration board of the AfD’s Thuringia branch rejected the federal party’s request to start the process of removing Höcke. By then, Petry, like Lucke before her, had left the AfD. The episode bolstered Höcke’s growing reputation as the real power behind Thuringia’s AfD. Madeleine Henfling, a Green politician and vice-president of Thuringia’s parliament, told me that Höcke appeared to exert tight control over the local branch of his party. “Dissenters either quickly resign or are made to leave,” she told me. She pointed to a recent dispute between Höcke and a local AfD lawmaker, Karlheinz Frosch, over a candidate list for district elections. Displeased with Frosch, Höcke drew up a separate list, called the Alternative for the District, to run against him. Frosch left the AfD soon after, complaining that: “For the rightwing extremist part of the party, Höcke is like a Godfather.” (When I met Braga, the AfD politician close to Höcke, he dismissed these characterisations as way off the mark. “A boss, a chairman, is sometimes someone who might hit the table and say, ‘No, we’re going to do it the way I think it’s right and the discussion is over.’ Mr Höcke is not such a leader. He leads by moderating and connecting,” he told me.) In March 2020, a few months after the AfD’s strong performance in Thuringia’s state elections, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency said it was placing The Wing under surveillance. The decision, unprecedented in the country’s modern history, was justified in a 436-page report, which referred to Höcke more than 600 times. In another setback for the AfD, the Covid-19 pandemic initially led Germans to rally around Chancellor Merkel. In the general election of 2021, the AfD lost 11 seats. Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, led a centre-left coalition with the Greens and market-liberal Free Democrats into power. But this ebb in the AfD’s fortunes proved temporary. As the pandemic wore on, more Germans became receptive to conspiratorial views. (Höcke suggested the pandemic had been “staged” to prepare the way for “a new surveillance state”.) Scholz’s coalition fell into infighting and plummeting approval over policies from installations of climate-friendly heat pumps to its handling of inflation and the war in Ukraine. In September 2023, Thuringia was back in the headlines when the local CDU voted in tandem with the AfD, this time to lower property taxes. This was not the first time that the centre-right had broken the “firewall” – the principle that no mainstream party would ever lend legitimacy to the far right by co-operating with them. But this time, the backlash was relatively muted. “The ‘firewall’ is history – and Thuringia is just the beginning,” Weidel, the AfD’s national chief, wrote on X after the vote. By the time of Höcke’s trial in May 2024, with four months to go before state elections, the AfD’s polling lead in Thuringia appeared unassailable. The CDU, perhaps mindful that they had been criticised for helping the far-right exercise power, decided to stage a televised debate between their state leader, Mario Voigt, and Höcke. Though heavily publicised, and featuring several sharp attacks on Höcke – who, at one point, professed not to remember a passage from his own book – the confrontation did not change the AfD’s popularity at state level. In Madeleine Henfling’s view, the effort was misguided from the start. “I always say that talking to the AfD is like playing chess with a pigeon. At some point they will shit on your chessboard and knock over all the pieces,” she told me. “People always believe that fascists, that Nazis, are stupid. That’s total bullshit, of course. They have an ideology and they know exactly how to get their ideology into society. They have strategies for it.” On the trial’s second day, the purpose of the history books Höcke had brought became clear. Höcke’s defence rested on the argument that he had not known “Everything for Germany” was a Nazi slogan. In his debate with Voigt, he claimed he’d been riffing on Donald Trump’s “America First”, which he’d combined with the title of the local AfD branch’s election manifesto – “Everything for our homeland” – to achieve an “ascending rhetorical cascade”. The books, which he’d used as a history teacher, showed why it was silly to think he should have known better: not one mentioned the slogan. “The history teacher is not a polymath,” Höcke said. He could not know every single thing that had occurred in the past. “You are a criminal lawyer,” he said, addressing the prosecutor. “What knowledge do you have of patent law?” Höcke’s defence evoked a quandary at the heart of Germany’s militant approach to defending its postwar liberal order: where to draw the line? Many phrases, such as “Heil Hitler”, obviously fall under the scope of Paragraph 86a. Others, such as “Führer”, a common term applied to bus drivers and tour guides, and “Lebensraum”, which is widely used in ecology, do not. (One of the stranger aspects of learning German as an adult can be undoing your old associations with these terms.) Playing in the ambiguous space between these two extremes is something of a pastime for Germany’s far-right. The numbers “18” and “88” – corresponding to the letters of the alphabet, with 18 meaning “AH”, for “Adolf Hitler”, and 88 meaning “HH”, for “Heil Hitler” – are often used in neo-Nazi circles, and have been upheld by courts as legal, for instance. I’ve reported on neo-Nazi concerts where attenders wore shirts with phrases such as “12 Golden Years”, without specifying which years, and “Adolf and Eva”, without surnames attached. In a 2019 essay, Götz Kubitschek, the rightwing publisher and intellectual, argued that rightwing movements should “provocatively push forward into the border areas of what is just about sayable and doable” to create linguistic “bridgeheads”. They could then pursue a tactic of “interlocking”, whereby one would “advance, capture a few positions, and create an unclear situation” to prevent “enemy artillery” from firing. Linguistically, this meant “quoting and referring to speakers from the establishment who have said the same thing before, or at least something similar”. The final step was Selbstverharmlosung – a term meaning “self-trivialisation” – to “tear down the ‘emotional barrier’” built and “lovingly maintained” by the old elites against political alternatives. (Kubitschek did not answer my emails seeking comment.) It is easy to suspect that Höcke, a longtime friend of Kubitschek, is playing precisely this game. Yet proving it is almost impossible. The prosecution in Halle took a swing at it all the same. Under cross-examination, Höcke was asked about some of his past statements. His use of words such as “Volksverderber” and “Tat-Elite” suggested he had “quite detailed historical knowledge of the vocabulary in the Third Reich”, did it not? Höcke responded that the terms were also used in the 19th century, for whose “flowery language” he had a soft spot. Be that as it may, could he really have missed the case of Ulrich Oehme, an AfD member in Saxony who had been investigated for using “Everything for Germany” on a campaign poster in 2017? Höcke said he hadn’t learned of the case until later. Part of the reason might have been that he had consciously avoided “established media” out of a need for “psychological self-protection”. After all, his every utterance was picked apart by “hundreds of antifascists”, who had made an industry of “discrediting and hounding” him. He had, he said, been made “the devil of the nation”. During a May Day address in Hamm, a town in the old industrial heart of Germany’s Ruhr valley, Höcke took this argument directly to his supporters. He invoked the spectre of witch trials and the Inquisition, and compared his case to those of Socrates, Jesus Christ and Julian Assange. “The club of justice is always used to beat the head of the dissident, the head of the opposition – and now it’s being used to beat mine.” Near the speech’s conclusion, Höcke said: “Times are changing, and people are realising that the signs point to a storm.” The last phrase, Kemper, the sociologist, was quick to point out, was a headline run by a prominent Berlin newspaper the day Hitler was named chancellor. The final session opened on a bright, cloudless morning in May. The prosecution began by reiterating their case, calling for a six-month prison sentence, “to make an impression on the accused and uphold the rule of law”. Then Höcke’s lawyers had their turn. Over more than two hours, all three spoke. References to Shakespeare and US supreme court Justice Benjamin Cardozo were made, as were promises to appeal against any conviction to the European court of human rights. Vosgerau delivered a point-by-point refutation of the prosecution, which built to a theoretical crescendo: “The difference between a liberal, constitutional state and a totalitarian state is not that there are very, very, very strict laws in a totalitarian state and in a free, constitutional state very lenient laws. The difference is that, in a totalitarian state, nobody knows exactly what is punishable. But everyone knows, from experience, that the state can declare pretty much anything you do to be a criminal offence if it wants to.” For all their verve, these were mere opening acts. Given his turn to speak, Höcke shot up from his chair. The idea that he had used the Nazi slogan deliberately was “one of those assumptions that is impossible, completely impossible to prove”, he said. Comparing himself to Joseph K, the protagonist of Franz Kafka’s The Trial, he said he could have never imagined he would be held to account “for such a banality, for such a triviality”. His parliamentary immunity had been removed eight times – not for bribery or corruption or breach of trust, but for expressing his opinion. “Am I not a human being? In the media, I’m treated as if I’m not.” About 10 minutes in, Judge Stengel interrupted. “Mr Höcke,” he said. “Get to the point. No campaign speeches.” Höcke nodded, but he would not be kept from a few more flourishes. “The Nazis also said ‘Guten Tag’,” Höcke said. “Do you want to ban the German language because the Nazis also spoke German? At some point, this has to end.” It was an argument Höcke and his supporters often deployed – that an unhealthy obsession with the past had caused the AfD’s critics to see Nazis everywhere. But over the months I spent reporting this piece, when I pressed Höcke’s critics on whether they might be overstating their case, they rarely relented. “He’s playing with things that mean, if he came to power as a chancellor in Germany, he would have to do very radical things to fulfil his promises to the people,” Matthias Quent, an expert on far-right extremism, told me. I was often reminded that the recent trial was not the first time that Höcke’s own words were used against him in a legal context. In 2019, a court in Thuringia was asked to rule on whether it would be libellous to call Höcke a “fascist”. The court said that it was not, because the view was “not pulled from thin air”, but stood on a “verifiable, factual basis”. As evidence, the judges had cited a passage in Never Twice in the Same River, which comes at the end of a chapter, apparently signalling that readers are meant to dwell on its full implications. In it, Höcke forecasts that Germans – “at least those who still want to be” – may someday need to “return to our rural retreats like the brave and cheerful Gauls of old”. These might serve as a “fallback position from which a reconquest will start”. He goes on to say that “our primary political goal is, of course, to prevent all of these scenarios”, but “the longer a patient refuses urgent surgery, the harder the necessary cuts will inevitably be”. A “large-scale remigration project”, built on a “policy of ‘well-tempered cruelty’”, will probably be needed. “This means that human hardship and unpleasant scenes cannot always be avoided.” He concludes that “existential crises require extraordinary action”. In Halle, the court fell silent as Höcke finished his speech. A final recess was called. When, an hour later, the court reassembled, Judge Stengel began quickly, almost anticlimactically, to read out the verdict. “The court has to listen to almost everything, but it doesn’t have to believe everything,” he said. For all their discursions into historical and philosophical nuance, the defence’s case had stumbled on one salient point: it was “unrealistic” that Höcke had not known about the other AfD members running into trouble over the same phrase. Even so, a prison sentence would be “completely excessive”. Höcke would receive a fine of €13,000. (Höcke’s team would later appeal the sentence, which a federal court is deliberating.) Addressing Höcke, Stengel said: “You are an eloquent, intelligent man, who knows what he is saying.” As the sentence was read, Höcke looked deflated. The hearing was over.

The state’s water agency said it had disconnected Medlow Dam from the region’s water supply as a precautionary measure while further investigations were conducted. Medlow Dam does not supply raw water directly. The water travels through other dams in the network to the Cascade water filtration plant, which then supplies treated drinking water to Blue Mountains communities. Sydney Water confirmed the water supplied from the Cascade plant to communities was safe to consume and met the Australian drinking water guidelines. In a statement, WaterNSW said it had been conducting targeted investigations in the Blue Mountains area in the upper reaches of the greater Sydney catchment to ensure other agencies had up-to-date information on the presence of PFAS. PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are sometimes called “forever chemicals” as they are difficult to destroy. There are about 12,000 PFAS and strong evidence of health harms – including an association with cancer – primarily exists for just two: PFOA and PFOS. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies PFOS as possibly carcinogenic but notes there is “inadequate” evidence that it directly causes cancer. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email An expert health panel report on PFAS delivered to the Australian government found “no current evidence that suggests an increase in overall cancer risk” from the chemicals. Research on the chemical compound PFHxS is ongoing and the evidence for any health impacts is less comprehensive than for PFOA and PFOS. Testing of untreated water at Medlow Dam found levels of PFOS and PFHxS combined were 0.09 micrograms per litre. This is slightly above the levels set for treated water – o.o7 micrograms per litre – under the Australian drinking water guidelines. Once Medlow Dam water is processed through the Cascade plant, the levels of PFOS and PFHxS in drinking water remained well within the safe limits, WaterNSW said. “Preliminary results, published on the WaterNSW website, indicate Medlow Dam is the only part of the Blue Mountains dam network returning elevated results,” the agency said in a statement. “This dam does not supply raw water directly, but as a precautionary measure has been disconnected from supply while further investigations are conducted.” Once the water leaves Medlow Dam, it travels through Greaves Dam and the upper, middle or lower Cascade dams before reaching the Cascade filtration plant. Tests found PFAS levels in the untreated water that reached the filtration plant were within the Australian drinking guidelines. Prof Stuart Khan, a water expert and the head of the civil engineering school at the University of Sydney, speaking generally said if contaminants were detected in water it was appropriate that authorities tried to identify the source and conduct remediation if necessary. “But at this point … the message Sydney Water has been trying to give is that exposure [to PFAS] is at safe levels and there’s nothing to be alarmed about,” he said. Khan said he did not believe it was necessary to close Medlow Dam and, at some stage, the water supply in the dam would be needed again. “It’s sending a message that there’s a problem when the problem is nowhere near as significant as it’s been presented in the media,” he said. Khan said he was concerned some media reports were “doing a lot of damage in terms of public trust in water supply”. “It’s generating fear where there shouldn’t be and there’s a risk they [regulators] then get priorities wrong.”"
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/28/nvidia-nvda-q2-earnings-report,Nvidia rides big tech’s AI investment to beat Wall Street’s sky-high expectations,"[{'image_url': 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7f42273998958b2ec755bbb120e26340016bfed/0_0_6000_3987/master/6000.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none', 'image_alt': 'a man in a leather jacket speaks while holding a technological item'}]","Chipmaker Nvidia reported its latest financial results on Wednesday, recording $30.04bn in revenue over the past three months – a 122% jump from the year prior – and showing that artificial intelligence investment mania shows no signs of cooling. Analysts had anticipated about $28.7bn in revenue. Shares slid more than 3% in after-hours trading. In an earnings call, founder and CEO Jensen Huang said he expected Nvidia to ship “a lot more” chips and hardware next year than the company had in its 31-year history. “The reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because the complexity of the model is growing, and we want to drive its costs down, and we want to increase the scale of AI models so that it will reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and realize the next industrial revolution,” he said. Analysts welcomed the results, despite signs that Nvidia’s extraordinary sales growth might ultimately slow. “The company continues to benefit from a market paradox: big tech’s aggressive AI investment strategies drive massive demand for Nvidia’s chips, even as these same companies invest in developing their own silicon,” said Jacob Bourne, a technology analyst with Emarketer. Nvidia has told customers that its next-generation AI chips, code-named Blackwell, will be delayed several months from January, though early samples are shipping to a small group of customers now. However, its current line of graphics processing units, nicknamed Hopper, continues to sell well, chief executive officer Jensen Huang said in a press release. “Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,” Huang said. “Nvidia achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI.” The company’s data center revenue, its most closely watched financial metric, increased by 154% from a year ago to $26.3bn. Recent earnings reports from Nvidia’s main big tech customers – Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google – which use the company’s chips to build and train their own AI models, indicated higher capital spending as AI demand continues to rise. “As competitors like AMD intensify their efforts, the timely release of Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chip will be essential for maintaining its dominant position in the increasingly competitive AI chip market,” said Bourne. The importance of Nvidia’s earnings results to Wall Street can hardly be overestimated – the company represents 6% of the total value of the S&P 500, currently the third most valuable company in the world by market capitalization at $3.1tn. The index has gained 27% over the past 12 months, but Nvidia is individually up 167% over the same period. But because big tech is driving US stocks to new record highs, and because spending on Nvidia is seen as a signal of future tech earnings, Nvidia’s results are a key barometer of the US stock market. The company also reported $0.68 in earnings per share and announced a $50bn stock buy-back. Analysts expected $0.64 per share for the quarter, compared to $13.5bn in revenue a year earlier. Profits were seen at $15.1bn, up from about $6.2bn a year earlier. The company’s last earnings, released in May, showed quarterly growth of 18% and annual revenue growth of 262%. Against that extraordinary precedent, anything less than a repeat could be seen as a disappointment. The Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called Nvidia’s earnings call “the most important week for the stock market this year and potentially in years”. Ives estimates that for every $1 spent on an Nvidia GPU chip, there is a $8-$10 multiplier across the tech sector. “In a nutshell, we expect another drop-the-mic performance from Nvidia, as right now Jensen & Co are the only game in town with $1tn of AI cap-ex [capital expenditure] on the way for the next few years with Nvidia’s GPUs the new oil and gold in this world,” he added. The expectations are so high, in fact, that Ameriprise Financial’s Anthony Saglimbene told Bloomberg that the results could have more impact on the overall market than Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s speech last week at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. But placing so much emphasis on a single stock itself rests on the concept that AI will boost global productivity over the coming decades. The enormous $100bn annual investment into AI has yet to translate into profits for big tech, and its not yet clear when they will arrive. Conversely, a disappointing set of results could leads to doubts – and that we are at peak AI hype. That’s led to comparisons to the late 1999 Internet bubble when the sector crashed but later recovered as the online world we know today on its skeletal remains. In his market hand-holding mode, Ives said in a note that investors may worry about the huge spending, but the circumstances are more like 1995, when investment was pouring into the internet’s infrastructure, and not like 1999 when the bubble burst. “Tech earnings season has only bolstered and validated this bullish view of tech stocks heading into year-end and 2025,” Ives says. As with Microsoft in the early 2000s, regulators are hovering over Nvidia. Earlier this month, the US Department of Justice launched an antitrust investigation into the tech giant. Rival chipmakers have alleged the company has abused its market dominance to corner the market and coerce its customers into continuing to purchase its products."

I’ve got work experience and internships from the UK, Paris and Hong Kong. I’ve taken courses, networked and am working in an admin job to try to get more skills, after no luck with applications.” Having graduated from the University of Oxford with a first class BA in English and French last year, Emma*, a 23-year-old from London, said she has been on the hunt for a graduate job in publishing and adjacent industries since. She is now sending out five applications a week, alongside a full-time job, and has so far secured just four interviews and an offer of a minimum wage internship – which was retracted. “My parents’ idea of ‘if you work hard, you’ll get what you want’ doesn’t really work any more. The older generations’ expectation that if you’ve got a ‘good degree and good skills you’ll be fine’ is just no longer tenable. I feel like I’m throwing myself at a brick wall.” Emma was one of dozens of recent university leavers from across the UK who shared their struggles to secure their first graduate job, in response to an online call-out by the Guardian. Graduates described “soul-destroying” job hunts in many apparently saturated fields spanning months or even years, companies that had “ghosted” applicants who had completed online assessments or taken months to respond, and being unable to land jobs they felt they were overqualified for. Even respondents who had graduated with a first class degree, often from prestigious universities, and even in subjects such as engineering, computing, cybersecurity or other STEM sectors thought to be crying out for skilled workers, said they had been sending dozens or even hundreds of applications without getting an interview. Although most UK students find jobs not long after leaving university – with 61% of those who graduated in 2022 having gained full-time work 15 months later – many of them will find non-graduate work only: according to the Office for National Statistics, last year just 60.4% of graduates living in England aged 21-30 were in “high-skilled” work, while 26.4% of this group were in medium or low-skilled employment and 5.5% unemployed. About half of the recent graduates who got in touch said they had taken non-graduate jobs in hospitality, retail, administration, call centres, supply teaching or in temporary positions on the minimum wage to keep afloat. Many said that jobs labelled as “entry level” positions usually require at least one, and often several, years of professional experience. Various people reported that they had been unaware how important practical experience was to recruiters, or that they had simply been unable to find a placement in a relevant industry or lacked the funds to support themselves through an unpaid internship, citing the high cost of living as a significant factor. “It’s been really tough,” said a 21-year-old from Suffolk, who has been unable to find graduate work. “I wish I’d known how important placements were – I had to drop my placement year as I couldn’t find any placements to apply to. There were a couple but I couldn’t afford commuting to London to then work for free.” One 25-year-old modern languages and literature graduate from Edinburgh, who is now working in hospitality, after failing to secure a single interview from more than 50 job applications sent in recent months, said: “The competition is extreme. I may have found employment more quickly and easily if I had taken a vocational degree and put my interests to one side.” Of the respondents who had been successful, many said their best advice for students was to contact their university’s careers service, to gain as much practical experience as possible before, during and after their degree, and to pick up additional skills. Noah, 23, a data analyst from Norwich, said he found his £36,000-a-year job because he had taught himself the coding language Python during his international relations and modern history BA, and subsequently applied for graduate schemes at two large software engineering companies. “Although I didn’t necessarily have the skills they expected for a software engineer, Python gave me a bit of an edge, and my now manager picked up that I was easy to get along and work with in a team,” he said. Several respondents from overseas said they had all but given up on the search and were likely to return, or had already returned, home to countries such as Poland and Italy, where they felt they may have better chances. Scores of graduates cited frustrations with time-consuming applications recruiters rarely responded to, and many felt that it mattered more “to know the right people” or to possess insider knowledge than to meet the formal job criteria. Notably, graduates looking for work in the arts, design and humanities said they had found it impossible to find graduate work without connections. Gabriel, 25, a history and English graduate from London, sent 500 applications and, after being rejected from more than 20 internships for being “overqualified”, he finally landed a £25,000-a-year admin job thanks to “secondhand nepotism”, he said. “It’s all based on referrals,” Gabriel said. “There’s just too many people looking for entry-level jobs.” Despite recruiters’ claims that there is strong demand for highly skilled workers, employers on average received 86 applications for each graduate vacancy in 2023, up 23% on the previous year, according to a report by the Institute of Student Employers. Yet, 54% of employers told the survey that they found it difficult to recruit at least one of their graduate roles – an 11% increase – suggesting that there is an oversupply of graduate workers lacking relevant skills. Employers also appear reluctant to take on or train young staff amid a fragile economic climate. Total UK employer investment in skills has been in steep decline, having fallen 19% for each employee, in real terms, between 2011 and 2022. There have been even sharper declines in larger businesses (-35%) and primary (-44%), and public (-38%) service sectors, leading to an underequipped workforce and employers struggling to fill vacancies, despite steady growth in graduate numbers. With graduate jobs increasingly concentrated in London, 42% of university-educated workers outside the city now work in a job that does not require a degree, up from 31% in 1993. The share is highest in Lincolnshire and Cumbria, where more than half of graduates work in non-graduate jobs (58% and 52%), according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Some of those respondents whose parents lived in London said they were able to stay with them while job hunting, while others reported having to return to their home towns as they lacked the funds to search for graduate work in bigger cities. A number of people said they had, in desperation, enrolled in master’s degrees or even PhDs because they had been unable to find gainful employment after graduation. Several respondents said they had big concerns about potentially discriminatory AI tools aiding recruiters in their selection of candidates, and many complained about having to film awkward video interviews that did not allow them to present themselves naturally. Joshua Morgan, 30, from Tarbolton, South Ayrshire, who managed to find a job as a power systems consultant, said he is very happy after graduating with an MSc in renewable energy systems technology last year, but he is concerned that the recruitment systems he encountered were “geared so much against people coming in”. “Getting through that initial sift is so much harder now than it was. Amazing people from my course are still looking [for jobs] because automatic filters don’t allow people to show you their worth,” he said. “I applied to 150 jobs over several months with a 10% success rate for interviewing. Just sending that many tailored CVs and cover letters into a void is soul-destroying and I’m one of the lucky ones who landed a job in the industry I wanted in a relatively small amount of time.” Application processes for graduate schemes in particular had been, in his experience, “hostile, impersonal and condescending”. He added: “Employers know they have a lot of choice and many treat you poorly in the application process because of it. It’s very depressing.” *Name has been changed"

PA Photo. See PA story POLITICS Tory. Photo credit should read: Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire'}]","I have to start this review by declaring an interest. As a former Conservative MP, expelled from the party for standing as an independent in 2019, I had, apart from that election, never campaigned against a Conservative candidate. In June this year, however, I made the decision to support the independent James Bagge (another former Conservative), who stood against Liz Truss in South West Norfolk. His intervention, as a former member of her Conservative Association, helped overturn one of the largest Conservative majorities in the country – he secured more than 6,000 votes. My reason for doing this was that I thought it wrong for a former prime minister who had done so much damage, albeit unintentionally, to our country’s economic wellbeing and reputation to stand again. As was clear on the ground during the campaign and in its outcome, this was also the view of her constituents. Anthony Seldon, now with the help of Jonathan Meakin, has become the leading authority on our contemporary prime ministers and the challenges they face in office. So, it was natural that after last year’s Johnson at 10, he would want to consider Truss. The problem, however, is that 49 days provides rather thin material for a book, as does any account of the steps that got her there. Truss’s personal background and prior political career are covered quickly, in about 12 pages out of 330. Seldon identifies her core belief as being free market liberalism with a deep suspicion of entrenched vested interests. He sees her as an autodidact. He says that “Truss zipped up the ministerial ladder. But she never felt particularly successful on the rungs, nor was she to win many admirers for her pirouettes as she reached the top.” As a former colleague, I think this encapsulates well how she was viewed within the parliamentary party under Cameron and May. Whether it was her speech to party conference on the “DISGRACE” of importing apples, pears and cheese, or her failure, as lord chancellor, to defend the judiciary when they were attacked in the media as “enemies of the people”, she was not seen as a political heavyweight, or taken seriously by most Conservative MPs. Seldon is kinder on her period as foreign secretary, where he sees her as having shown considerable acumen in establishing a reputation as an international crusader for liberty. But this was accompanied by an almost obsessional self-regard, with every overseas trip turned into a photo opportunity. Seldon has therefore chosen to turn her short period in office into a textbook of how not to govern, a sort of reverse of Machiavelli’s The Prince. In previous work, he has outlined a number of steps he believes are key to a prime minister’s success. He compares her performance with each such requirement and finds it wanting in every case. Thus on the need to “secure the power base” he shows how her campaign for the leadership, while skilful, was based on an appeal to the party membership, still grieving at the loss of Boris Johnson and attracted by his endorsement, as well as her own promises of tax cuts. It left those MPs who had had the courage to vote to get rid of Johnson for overwhelmingly good reasons “sceptical, cynical and even angry” – a bad way to start a premiership where she needed to build their support. Seldon rightly sees Truss as having had a bold plan for government, but it was never realistic. Her decisions were the product of “self-reinforcing groupthink, as confidence and daring led to arrogance and, ultimately, hubris”. She packed her cabinet with a narrow group of supporters. A member of her team tells Seldon that she said: “I have beaten my enemies, I have beaten the fucking establishment. I’m not going to bother to build bridges.” Yet for all this bravado, she struck an anonymous figure when big events such as the death of Queen Elizabeth gave her the opportunity to present herself as a stateswoman. Seldon notes that, as a committed Atlanticist, she utterly mishandled relations with President Joe Biden, prompting what he describes as the most humiliating presidential put down of a prime minister in modern history, when he openly described her economic policies to journalists as a mistake. Truss’s downfall was the result of the big policy failure of her mini budget, the resulting loss of any reputation for economic competence, a humiliating U-turn in having to appoint Jeremy Hunt chancellor and ditch her plans for growth, and the resulting collapse in confidence – such as it was – among her MPs. Seldon writes very well on this. His research has been extensive and the commentary is fleshed out with dialogue and quotations, which he assures us have been checked for accuracy and make for compelling reading. His verdict is harsh. “Britain has had a procession of underperforming Prime Ministers … Johnson, the subject of the previous book in the series, and now Truss, comfortably outdid them all in their wilful inability to rise to the requirement of thoughtful and responsible stewardship the job entails”. As I write this, news comes in of Truss’s talk in Beccles, Suffolk, where promotion of her book Ten Years to Save the West was interrupted by the unfurling of a poster of a cross-eyed lettuce with the caption “I crashed the economy”. Other politicians might have turned an incident like this to their advantage. She simply walked off, saying: “That’s not funny”. I would add to Seldon’s requirements for prime ministers the need for a self-deprecatory sense of humour.

Who among us hasn’t bought a piece of exercise kit only for it to gather dust in a corner, or start a new life as a clothing rack? That’s because, if trainer Dalton Wong is to be believed, we’ve been buying the wrong stuff. The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more. “Only buy equipment that you’re going to use as part of your lifestyle,” says Wong, who trains everyone from award-winning actors to elite athletes. “We should do most of our cardiovascular training outside because we spend so much time inside. At home, work on strength, flexibility and mobility.” Ty Paul, who gets Olympic athletes and Premier League footballers in peak condition, as well as running fitness classes for the over-60s, says that when it comes to home equipment, we should “buy something versatile that can be used for multiple fitness goals – and generations”. Here’s what the experts recommend you invest in, whatever your fitness level. “At home, you need three things: a form of resistance (weights, resistance bands or gliders); something restorative (a yoga mat); and something regenerative (a tennis ball, a foam roller or, if you have lots of money, a massage gun),” says Wong. “To burn extra calories, wear it throughout the day,” says Wong. “If you have a lighter vest, use it for low-intensity cardio, such as your bike ride or dog walk, to increase the demand on your body. Lastly, wear it to do resistance training. If you have a 5kg vest, with 2kg dumbbells in each hand, that’s 9kg of work you’re doing from squatting, lunging or push-ups.” Buy: Hyper Vest weighted vest, from £67 hyperwear.com “A lot of people get problems such as plantar fasciitis, sore feet and sore calves. Rolling a tennis ball under your foot is a great way to release that tissue. I also use it to roll my glutes out, so I sit on my bum, put my right ankle on my knee, put the tennis ball under the left side of my glutes and roll them out to break any knots. Lastly, with your back against the wall, put the tennis ball where your scapular – or shoulder blade – is and roll up and down. That releases the muscles between your shoulder blades through the middle part of your back.” Buy: Tennis-Point Premium 3 ball tube, £3.90 tennis-point.co.uk “You cannot put on an ab-stimulating machine while eating Doritos and watching Love Island, and expect to look like the contestants on Love Island,” says Wong. “There is science behind the medical-grade versions, but six sessions at a private clinic will cost you in the region of £3,000. People who use those machines – such as Rafael Nadal – are already in great shape.” “You need to make sure you’re performing exercises correctly, so if you’re following online videos, look for people who are renowned for their fitness knowledge,” says Michelle Griffith Robinson, a former Olympic triple-jumper, who’s now a trainer and specialist in fitness for perimenopausal and menopausal women. “Check their qualifications, and look at how long they’ve been in the business.” Perimenopausal and menopausal women need to focus on building muscle. “Strength-train first using your bodyweight by doing press-ups against the wall, squats, step-ups on your staircase, single leg lunges. Once you can do that, add weights.” Also tune in to your body. “During this transition, energy levels are depleted. Get into the fresh air to exercise two or three times a week and the endorphins will help. But sometimes, with the greatest will in the world, exercise is a tall order, so be kind to yourself.” “Weight training helps prevent osteoporosis and makes us feel stronger so we can do our daily activities: gardening, cleaning, bending, lifting,” says Griffith Robinson. “With weights, start off with your own bodyweight, then add on weights to do some squats and presses, assisted lunges, and compound movements like a shoulder press into a deep squat and back into a shoulder press.” Buy: Neoprene dumbbell hand weights, £64.99 proiron.com “They can travel with you anywhere. Ten minutes a day will improve your fitness significantly and is great way to control your pelvic floor. This is a good replacement for running when it’s terrible weather.” Buy: Opti 9ft skipping rope, £7 argos.co.uk “Strengthen your core naturally,” says Griffith Robinson. “Double up your skipping rope and hold it out in front of you, nice and taut, and go into a squat position. That will work your core, rather than an ab roller, which is going to shorten your muscles and your hip flexors. Planks on your elbows or hands are fantastic too. Imagine someone has a ruler across your back so you cannot dip. Hold that for 30 seconds on, 15 seconds off; or build up from 15 seconds to 20, 25, then 30.” When it comes to older clients, Ty Paul is clear: “They are a lot fitter than people think.” He suggests working on range of movement and flexibility “because we stiffen up as we age”. Strength training is also crucial “for bone density, but you don’t need to go heavy – my over-60s group use a resistance band, and some people use two tins of baked beans”. Ensure your workout is suitable for you and is age-appropriate. “But also find something you enjoy, so you’re more likely to sustain it,” says Paul. Beloved by professional athletes across sports including tennis, basketball and football, this is a “flash reflex training” system, where you use your hands, knees or feet to tap pods that light up in a variety of colours, for drills and games. “I use them with Premier League footballers to improve reaction times, decision making, agility and core stability,” says Paul. “I also use them with over-60s; it helps with coordination. If you’re improving that, you’re preventing falls.” The pods link to an app, so you can track progress. “A lady I train has Parkinson’s, and her doctor said there was no point exercising as it was better to stick with medication. We gave BlazePods a go, and after a year, she’s fitter and stronger than ever.” Buy: Starter kit, £349 blazepod.eu “These are like kettlebells, but more luxurious, says Paul. “They consist of a wooden handle and a leather bag filled with iron pellets, and they’re beautiful to look at. You can use them for cardiovascular fitness, muscle toning and core stability, as well as all dumbbell and kettlebell exercises . They help range of movement and coordination; you can isolate parts of your body, and do all-round body fitness. SwingBells aren’t cheap, but they stand the test of time.” Buy: SwingBells Set Club, £98 nohrd.com “A medicine ball – a weighted ball – provides you with a limited number of options as it’s mainly used to perform one exercise: Russian twists, whereas SwingBells, kettlebells or dumbbells have multiple uses. I have a vintage leather medicine ball in my gym, but it’s an ornament. I’ve been in that gym for 18 years and I’ve never once taken it off the shelf,” says Paul. When working out at home, says Kerri Major – a Glasgow-based personal trainer and sports dietitian – it’s important to enjoy what you’re doing, but also make progress. “A lot of people come into a gym and randomly pick what they like doing, but random training is only going to give you random results.” “You can buy different weights of kettlebell, allowing you to progress from a strength point of view. They’re useful for functional training too, because they allow us to use our own body to support our balance.” In terms of moves, says Major, “you can do goblet squats with one kettlebell or, if you have two, front squats with one in each arm. You can also do Romanian deadlifts or conventional deadlifts from the floor. For lunges, hold them in different positions to challenge you in different ways. For the upper body, you can do overhead presses, rows, presses from your chest, and biceps and triceps options, where you can load in different ways.” Buy: Primal Pro Series Cast Kettlebell, £19,99 primalstrength.com “A lot of people struggle to do vertical pulls at home,” says Major. “Pull-ups aren’t all about bragging rights: you can do different variations depending on how you have your hands, which helps us to target lots of different muscle groups. Often, people think it’s just squats and deadlifts that matter, but your upper body is so important in everyday life, for everything from reaching up to carrying heavy shopping.” Buy: Universal door pull-up bar, £39.95 gravity.fitness “Power plates came first and were marketed as a way to tone up and lose weight, because you need to use your core strength to make sure you’re not wobbling. Then came vibrating hand weights, but there are more far more useful ways to train.” “The safest way to alleviate pregnancy symptoms is with exercise,” says Kira Mahal, personal trainer and founder of Motivate PT, who specialises in pregnancy and postpartum fitness. “In your first trimester, movement will help with sickness; in your second, your energy levels peak so you can increase strength training; then in the third, up the ante by strengthening your pelvic floor.” Mahal points out some important rules for pregnancy fitness. “Don’t get too out of breath, because that can restrict airflow to the foetus,” she says. “Don’t do deep abdominal twists; and don’t lie on your back, because that will restrict blood flow. Avoid overstretching, because pregnancy makes us more flexible as we have relaxin in our bodies [a hormone produced by the ovaries and placenta]. And finally, pregnancy is absolutely not a time for rapid weight loss.” Postpartum, wait six weeks after a vaginal birth, or 12 weeks after a c-section, to exercise. “Then it’s all recovery work. The idea of ‘snapping back’ is nonsense; our bodies change forever, and that needs to be embraced. But I’m in the strongest physical shape of my life after two kids.” “These are the holy grail for anyone, and a gentle way to build strength,” says Mahal. “You can incorporate a resistance band into almost any exercise: put it above your knees for a banded squat, do reps in and out with your knees pulsing, or do biceps curls holding the handles and curl upwards with one end around your foot.” Buy: Mini resistance-band set (pictured), £7.95 mirafit.co.uk Set of five resistance bands, £12.50 johnlewis.com Also known as a stability ball, yoga ball or balance ball, a Swiss ball is like a space hopper but without the horns. It is used for core stability and strength exercises. “Sitting on it you find your centre of balance, which you lose when you’re pregnant,” says Mahal. “It’s a nice way to incorporate stability exercises, balance exercises and pelvic tilts. It helps to rock back and forth on it at the end of your third trimester when you can be very uncomfortable. You can also use it to assist exercises, so for a wall squat, put the ball underneath you for some added safety.” Buy: Exercise ball, £15 johnlewis.com “We don’t want pregnant women skipping, sprinting on a treadmill, or jumping on a trampoline. Also avoid online Hiit classes. Women come to us injured all the time because they shouldn’t be doing certain exercises. Postpartum, women are doing abdominal crunches at six weeks, when they might have abdominal separation, and crunches will make that worse.” “I tend to see a fear of exercise with my clients, because in the past they have had trips and falls, which result in injuries,” says Dom Thorpe, who provides personal training for people with disabilities and chronic conditions. “I see people with fatigue-based conditions who have gone too hard too fast. Managing intensity is important, but so is ensuring that exercises are performed safely, with fallback plans. If you have bad balance, for example, do things seated or where you have your sofa behind you, so if you fall, you fall safely.” “These look like one massive dumbbell, but they have a little dial that you twist to select the weight you want, so when you pick that up the rest are left on the floor. You can have something that ranges from 2.5kg to 25kg in one set of dumbbells rather than having an entire rack, so it’s a space saver, too.” Moves-wise, says Thorpe: “You can squat or do a sit-to-stand for the lower body, with the dumbbells dangling in your hands beside you. For the upper body, push forwards in your seat to work your chest and triceps. Pull backwards to target the upper back and the biceps, and push upwards, directly above your head.” Buy: BodyMax 25kg Selectabell adjustable dumbbell, £189 fitshop.co.uk “When people attempt to lift a heavy weight, it’s not necessarily their arm strength that gives up on them, it’s their grip strength. With active hands, a Velcro strap holds the dumbbells in place and fastens it, limiting the risk of injuries. The only downside is you usually need someone else to fasten them.” Buy: Active Hands general purpose gripping aid, £73.42 amazon.co.uk “My university led the research into these, and I participated. Scientists had me stand on a vibrating platform in a squatted position, with electrodes attached to my muscles, and measured whether it was more stimulating than me just standing in a squatted position. It was, but it was no more stimulating than me holding some weights and doing squats. Similarly, doing press-ups on the vibrating platform is more challenging than a standard press-up, but not more challenging than doing a bench press, or a dumbbell press.”"

According to Mason, the band’s biggest star, Steve Winwood, wasted no time in telling him four cold things: “I don’t like the way you write. I don’t like the way you sing. I don’t like the way you play. And we don’t want you in the band any more.” “I was in shock,” Mason recalls. “For me, that was the ultimate band.” Small wonder he has never fully put them behind him. Though Mason went on to release a string of gold and platinum hits as a solo artist, including a note-perfect solo debut, Alone Together in 1970, he makes clear in a brutally frank new memoir that, for him, Traffic remains the one that got away. He even goes so far as to cast his entire career as a frontman – which has now lasted at least 20 times longer than his days with Traffic – as a default for his true love, which is getting lost in the dynamics of a classic band. “As someone once wrote years ago, ‘Differences combine to form beauty,’” Mason said of an ideal band’s interplay. “Unfortunately, they also combine to drive people apart.” Mason’s tussles with Traffic, which continued fitfully for decades, are hardly the only dramatic bullet points in his book, which he titled after one of his biggest solo hits, Only You Know and I Know. In his 78 years, the singing/songwriting guitarist has been married four times (divorced three), gone bankrupt twice, suffered the loss of his son to drugs and been sued by several powerful record companies, including one that threatened to kill his career once and for all. Naturally, the book also chronicles his many historic accomplishments, including performing with Jimi Hendrix on the Electric Ladyland album, as well as with Eric Clapton in a nascent version of Derek and the Dominos; George Harrison on his best set, All Things Must Pass; the Rolling Stones on Beggars Banquet; Delaney & Bonnie on their historic 1969 tour; Cass Elliott on an unlikely joint album; and Michael Jackson, who sang backup for him on a solo work. Coming from a rural background in Worcester, England, Mason’s talents as a guitarist emerged early. After moving to London at the tail end of his teens, he quickly gained attention on the emerging rock scene, where he forged connections with members of Traffic well before their formation. He became close friends and performed in bands with Jim Capaldi, who played drums and wrote lyrics. He also sang backup vocals on several hits by the Spencer Davis Group, each electrified by the improbably soulful voice of a teenage Winwood. In the spring of 1967, when Winwood decided to leave Spencer Davis to form a more adventurous group, he turned to some guys he had jammed with on the side – Capaldi, Mason and multi-instrumentalist Chris Wood. “It was obvious that the band we were forming was going to be a hit because of Steve Winwood,” Mason said. “Then, it was a question of ‘What the hell are we going to sound like?’” To discover that, they ditched the distractions of the city to rent a dilapidated cottage in the countryside. Unknowingly, their move helped start a trend in bands going back to “the land” to record, presaging similar explorations by Bob Dylan and the Band in Woodstock and Fairport Convention in rural England. The pieces Mason wrote at the time were fanciful and more pop-oriented than the stuff the other members were writing. For Traffic’s debut album, Mr Fantasy, which appeared eight months after they began, Mason wrote and sang their biggest UK hit, a pop-psychedelic bauble titled Hole in My Shoe. It got to number two, beating the Winwood-Capaldi track Paper Sun at five. Despite their success, Mason made the shock decision to leave directly after their debut appeared. “I realized I needed more life experiences in order to write stuff that would become timeless,” he said. The fact that the other band members reacted to his decision with a shrug should have indicated to him their less than favorable opinions of his work. However, some months later, while the remaining Traffic members were working on their second album, they realized they didn’t have enough new songs to complete the record. At the time, Mason had been writing up a storm. Perhaps just for expediency’s sake, then, Traffic invited him back to help complete their self-titled sophomore work. For the album, Mason sang and wrote half the songs, including his classic Feelin’ Alright? Given the improvement in Mason’s writing and the increasing confidence of the band, Mason felt nothing but excitement about his future with them. But just two months later he was fired, a move he now believes stemmed from jealousy over him scoring some of their best-known songs. “I didn’t steal any money from them, I didn’t run off with their girlfriends. I don’t know what else it could be,” he said. Mason thinks the reasons they later gave to the press – that he was writing more pop-oriented songs than they wanted and that he wrote alone while they wrote together – were just excuses. He felt particularly burned by Capaldi’s coldness towards him since they had been close friends before. Interestingly, Mason’s book barely mentions Chris Wood. “I never really had a close relationship with him,” he said. It’s clear from our interview, however, that he didn’t think much of Wood’s work. “Chris was an art student first,” Mason said. “As a musician? A little bit, maybe.” Wood, who died of liver disease at 39, also had well-known drug problems. “At the Fillmore East, he collapsed face-down at the keyboards,” Mason said. “We were all experimenting of course but, sadly, Chris took it too far.” Wounded as Mason may have been by his sacking, he had no trouble attracting attention from other first-rank rockers. Ginger Baker contacted him about trying to form a new power trio after the collapse of Cream, but their jams didn’t jell. Then, he got an invitation to work with Hendrix, who he’d met while working with Traffic. In fact, he once invited Hendrix to jam with the band at the cottage but he said the other members turned up their noses. “They didn’t want any interlopers,” he said. For a while, there was talk of Mason replacing Noel Redding on bass in Hendrix’s band. Instead, he wound up playing acoustic guitar on Hendrix’s classic song Crosstown Traffic, along with adding some backup vocals and sitar on Electric Ladyland. In another break, Joe Cocker covered Mason’s song Feelin’ Alright (minus the question mark) on his hit debut album, adding a distinctly different piano and percussion arrangement that became definitive. After hearing Cocker’s take, Mason recalls thinking, “Shit, I should have done it that way!” Mason went on to play with Delaney & Bonnie on their historic British tour that also featured Clapton and Harrison. In his book, Mason describes showing Harrison some moves on slide guitar on the tour that greatly affected his signature smooth style on All Things Must Pass. The Delaney & Bonnie tour, and subsequent live album, also introduced a new song Mason had written, Only You Know and I Know, which would become the lead track on his 1970 solo debut, released two months later. Mason’s debut also stood out with its design. The first 250,000 copies featured a randomized swirl of color in the vinyl, making each a unique piece of art. His next album proved just as surprising, a collaboration with Cass Elliot, whom he had befriended in the Laurel Canyon scene. Though the album has its strengths, ultimately “it was just patched together”, Mason said, which helps account for the public’s indifferent reaction to it. Another factor was the friction at the time between him and his record company, the boutique label Blue Thumb. As their top-selling artist, Mason wanted to renegotiate what he considered an unfair contract, something they were loth to do. As tensions rose, Mason stole some tapes he had been working on, prompting them to retaliate by issuing an album of outtakes and demos under the title Headkeeper. The result so angered Mason, he gave press interviews telling fans not to buy it. During that same fraught period, Mason began jamming with Clapton and the rhythm section of Delaney & Bonnie’s band for what would become Derek and the Dominos. Unfortunately, Clapton was deep into heroin at the time and so, said Mason, “a lot of time was spent sitting around doing nothing. After a while, I said, ‘I can’t do this, guys. I’ve got to go.’” Shortly thereafter, Mason had another awkward encounter with Traffic. Improbably, they invited him back again, if only for a six-gig tour of England that yielded the exciting live album, Welcome to the Canteen. Asked why he thinks they brought him back given their fractious history, Mason surmises, “probably to fulfill some recording obligation”. Luckily, his solo career got a new shot of energy from a fresh contract with Columbia Records, leading to a major hit in 1977 with the single We Just Disagree. Eventually, however, contract issues arose with the new label as well, leading to a near ruinous suit in which the company’s lawyer told him at one point: “We’re going to bury you.” “Take your best shot,” Mason recalls answering back. The cumulative result of these encounters gave the guitarist a reputation for being difficult. “As far as I was concerned, they were being difficult,” he retorted. “My artistic integrity is all I have. This is my work: ‘don’t fuck with it!’” Like many classic rockers, Mason’s chart career ended with the 80s, but he has continued to be a reliably popular concert draw in all the decades since. Along the way, he also had a few more nasty swipes with Traffic. In the 90s, he and Capaldi reunited for a tour that included a show at New York’s Bottom Line. Winwood showed up in the audience that night, and though Capaldi had specifically warned Mason not to draw attention to him, towards the concert’s end the guitarist asked Winwood to come on stage to play with them. Winwood obliged, but he was clearly far from pleased about it. Asked if he was being deliberately provocative by inviting Winwood up, Mason said: “Of course! I didn’t care. It was my show, my stage and you’re stuck!” Things went even further south in 2003 when Traffic were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. For the performance segment, Mason proposed a guitar duel between him and Winwood on Dear Mr Fantasy to underscore their role as one of music’s first jam bands. Instead, Winwood insisted on playing guitar alone, relegating Mason to bass, a position he turned down flat. “It was turning into the Steve Winwood show,” Mason said. The bad blood even ran into the afterlife. In 2017, well after Capaldi’s death, Mason sensed enough of a thaw to propose a tour with Winwood under Traffic’s name. Winwood shot it down, saying that Capaldi had made him promise on his deathbed never to tour under the band’s banner again. “For somebody to elicit that promise on a deathbed, it’s just fucking bizarre,” Mason said of Capaldi’s request. “It’s machiavellian.” Regardless, the guitarist found his own route back to his classic band just this year. He’s currently performing across the US on a Traffic Jam tour, which features reinvented versions of the band’s old material. He has not heard from Winwood on the move. As vulnerable as Mason has made himself by airing all these frustrations in public, he wrote in his book that doing so had given him peace. “On one level, I could hate every one of them,” he said of the other Traffic members.

Instead, cruise passengers who signed up for a three-year voyage around the world have been gazing at a rainswept quayside in Belfast for the past three months after a series of delays. The Odyssey, operated by the US cruise line Villa Vie Residences, was scheduled to depart from the Titanic Quarter in Belfast on 30 May. But problems with the ship’s rudders and gearbox mean the Odyssey is still docked. Passengers who had paid up to $899,000 (£682,000) to buy a cabin arrived in May expecting to set sail in days. For the past three months they have been permitted to spend their days onboard but must disembark overnight. “We can have all of our meals and they even have movies and trivia entertainment. [It’s] almost like cruising except we’re at the dock,” said Holly Hennessey, from Florida, who is travelling with her cat, Captain. A big downside to the delay was the weather, she told the BBC. “I’ve never had so much use for my umbrella in my life, and I carry my raincoat everywhere I go.” Villa Vie Residences said it was doing everything it could to “relieve the anxiety” of passengers by planning trips and other cruises or putting them up in hotels. Earlier publicity material from the company claimed it was a “leading innovator in modern-day residential cruising”. It offered prospective passengers the chance to buy a cabin for the 15-year life of the vessel, for between $99,999 and $899,000 plus monthly fees. In that time they would get unlimited cruises. Those unable or unwilling to make such a commitment could book shorter spells onboard, from 35 to 120 days. Although its target market is retired people, the company stipulates no minimum age for its residents. Their average age is 58 and half the cabins are occupied by one person, according to the company. Eighty per cent of owners come from the US, and about nine in 10 plan to stay onboard for the full world cruise. The Odyssey was built in 1993 and can hold 929 passengers. Its eight decks have three restaurants, eight bars, four lounges, a library, a business centre and a gym and spa. It offers live music, lectures and film screenings, and a complimentary medical service during cruises. Hennessey, who described herself as a “cruise addict”, said: “I have always wanted to live on a ship, and it will be a dream come true for me.” Her cabin has a double bed, a small living area with room for her cat, and a balcony. “Villa Vie is a community, and a real community has pets,” she said. Stephen Theriac, from Nicaragua, said he and his wife had “eaten in every [nearby] restaurant and had a Guinness in every pub”. The long delay was “just all part of our adventure”. David Austin, from Georgia in the US, said he had “stopped counting down” the days until the ship launched. “The payoff of seeing the world in this fashion is too great to feel too disappointed with each delay announcement,” he said. “I was committed, having sold my house right before my arrival, and I’ve stayed committed to this adventure.” Mike Petterson, the chief executive of Villa Vie Residences, said: “Despite having to do major works such as the rudder stocks, major steel work and engine overhauls, we have persevered and are now in the last stages of departure. We expect a successful launch next week [after which] we will head to Bremerhaven, Amsterdam, Lisbon, then across the Atlantic for our Caribbean segment. “We are extremely grateful for our residents who have stood by our side through the tough times. It is great to see the relationships building and the community bonding as we are looking forward to the next 15 years of discovery.”"
